My accident happened in 2015, and indeed if things had worked out differently, I wouldn't have to work another day in my life. Because of my failure to do this I've been a heavy burden on friends and family ever since. Some of them have literally begged me to pursue it, and my failure to has been chalked up to some combination of negligence and stubbornness. I certainly don't claim to *not* be those things. But the reason here is much different, and hopefully I can explain it a little to clear up some confusion. What follows is not my personal opinion, but the result of several doctor visits and medical examinations.\n\nA person's disability status is dependent upon their occupation. What would be a completely devastating event (eg. losing a hand) to one person, say, a carpenter, might be practically inconsequential to another, or at least not a significant hinderance to their productivity in their chosen profession. I happen to fall into this second category. Believe it or not... programming really does not require much typing at all. Mostly just thinking, and I do that just fine. This is why it is common to see people collecting checks for what seems like much less serious shortcomings than mine.\n\nIn 2016, I went back to school (again). But this time I decided to put my music degree on hold and study more academic subjects, eventually falling in love with psychology. But then, my funding suddenly went away and I ended up on the street, and was forced to leave Austin because the police would not leave me alone. It has been a great struggle ever since, but I've managed to teach myself computer science over the last 4 years and have gained some very employable skills.\n\nIt's simply a matter of persistence. I have 3 different potential employers I'm talking to right now. But much more importantly, I absolutely love what I do! I wouldn't trade this decision for anything."

        "post": "Covid Lockout Day #2\n\nSleep? We don't do much of that while in lockout. Not very safe, ironically because of the threat of police harassment. That's not what this post is about, but having spent many years on the street, reality has reminded me once again who the real thugs are.\n\nAnother thing that I've rediscovered about myself is that I come up with some of my best ideas when I walk around all night. And it could be that the rhythm of my footsteps activates my musical sense, because I'm turning my attention once again to the construction of my software synthesizer, the MECCA Platform. And this time it's all about math.\n\nWhat's the huge deal with me and math lately, anyway? Well, the truth is, I'm 39 years old and the first time I actually used math was 3 years ago, when I decided to start building my own music application from first principles.\n\nI used to laugh in people's faces who would suggest such a ridiculous idea, that *music* has anything to do with *math*. But now I know that they were right, and now I know why.\n\nThis is all fitting together quite well, because this application, \"MECCA\", the Music Education Composition Creation Application, is all about being a tool for music production that also *teaches* you about theory and sound design by exposing to the user sonic parameters that are directly modeled from the acoustic principles at play, which become the actual parameters used to modulate the soundwaves. In addition to this educational component, another factor at play is *my own* education, which is being forged by the grand journey of me building the thing! I'm teaching *myself* about the fundamentals of music by learning to code a synth myself. And the stuff I'm discovering has been rather mindblowing:\n\nMusic IS math. I wouldn't go so far as to say that's *all* it is, but a nearly infinite amount of computation is involved in its every aspect. Here they are, in the order of my own discovery:\n\n1. The pitches of the notes. The human faculty of audio perception is very interesting because it operates on a logarithmic scale, both in volume (dB) and pitch (Hz). In pitch, this is clearly demonstrated by the frets of a guitar, which get closer together as you go higher up the neck. This is because each note needs to be calculated as 2^1/12 the frequency of the one preceding it.\n\n2. Tempo (bpm). Effectively this comes down to the *length* of the notes. To calculate note length of a quarter-note from beats-per-minute you need to divide 60 seconds by the desired tempo. Fun fact: James Best, my high school jazz band director once asked, \"which note determines the tempo of the song?\" The correct answer: the second one. It's the 2nd beat that tells you how far they are apart, right? While that makes sense in a practical setting, as far as the notes are concerned the answer is *every note*! Every note needs to be exactly the correct length with respect to the song's tempo.\n\n3. The very soundwaves themselves! Any acoustic sound can be mathematically described by its Fourier constants - a set of Complex (Real/Imaginary) numbers that, when run through a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), will result in the production of the waveform.\n\n4. Scales. Music notation is in fact a graph-fitting problem, as the notes are spaced at cycling intervals from each other. These scales must then be fit along the graph - representing the intervals on a 2-dimensional plane with time as the x-axis and pitch as the y-axis.\n\n5. Harmony. The overtone series comes into play here, which is an infinitely ascending cascade of notes that emanate from any acoustic tone.\n\n6. *All the computation performed by the human auditory system*. This includes the entire phenomenon of psychoacoustics, also related to the overtone series above. This is how our sense of hearing is adapted towards identifying the location and quality of the sound as it is situated in the sonic environment.\n\nMost of these connections were relatively unknown to me when I began this project just a few years ago. I knew that I wanted to create a synthesizer/sequencer with a more transparent and interactive set of parameters by which to control the sound. For example, it was to feature a \"kick-drum wizard\" that guides you through the construction of a kick drum, giving the experienced producer unprecedented control while unobtrusively revealing to the novice what sonic building blocks are composed to create a kick drum. But I just realized it goes much deeper still!\n\nIntroducing: MECCA-Math. The first digital audio workstation that is controlled completely algorithmically, exposing the very math that affects the character of the sound as the primary method of user input. We will be able to adjust the equations and receive sonic feedback in real time, bridging the intuitive gap between the human experience of music that we all know and love, and the algorithms that constitute them, all presented through a human-tractable interface tuned to provide the optimal balance of sonic flexibility while subtly encouraging the use of effective culturally prescribed idioms.\n\nI surely can't be the *only* one excited about this...\nMECCA Music Platform"

So I might as well make the best of this unprecedented experience by writing about it each day that I'm able to.\n\nFortunately????? (for me???) this lockdown is a bit of a joke. Because there actually seems to be plenty of places open. There's people hanging out everywhere - it's like a festival, actually. Pretty weird... feels all sorts of wrong. But life must go on. If this was a real lockdown, you'd think there wouldn't be anywhere for me to go, but today I went to the library and was actually able to gather enough mental focus to get a bunch of work done. Helping people in the community with software issues, expanding my computer algebra system I'm writing for a new educational platform, and taking part in the Exercism Markathon - a day my team planned for us all to spend working on our big upcoming release.\n\nWhere am I going to sleep? Don't know yet. And tomorrow is Sunday which is usually the trickiest as far as library hours go. I'm so dead focused on working on these projects that I refuse to let anything stop me, so every minute is spent planning how I am to maintain progress and will be documenting it all right here.\n\nI'm excited to be making some great progress on my math library: https://github.com/porkostomus/algae It now includes a complete set of functions for performing operations on polynomials. Next up is complex numbers. What this Computer Algebra System (CAS) is about is creating a system for people to learn math through programming. One way you could look at it is that I'm making a thing to help students cheat on their math homework. But the joke is actually on them, I guess, because through this process it ends up teaching them the important concepts behind the math while skipping the painful parts that cause too many people to grow up thinking that they hate math.\n\nMy team and I at exercism.io have been hard at work. Our website, which is already super cool and is made up of thousands of people all learning and teaching each other, is being completely revamped into an online coding platform. I've taken up the responsibility of building the code analyzer that works behind the scenes testing the user's solutions and providing instantaneous feedback. And I'm also the main person designing the curriculum and writing the exercises for the Clojure track. It's a wonderful and very rewarding thing to be involved with.\n\nIt's probably too soon for this idea, but I'm thinking I'd like to teach a programming class right here at the Ashland Public Library. Since thats where I'm gonna be spending all my time, it just makes sense, right? If you know anyone who might be interested in a new career in making computer beep boop boop beep... please spread the word. The classes will be free, and the only donations I'll be accepting are leads on places to live.\n\nIf for some reason you'd like to support me on these endeavors by sending me money, that'd be awesome too! Every coffee that I'm able to purchase is another chance for me to sit down and get shit done.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/porkostomus?fan_landing=true\nLiberapay: https://en.liberapay.com/porkostomus/\nPayPal: btowers793@gmail.com"

It sure is refreshing.\n\nThis feels very strange. I wasn't expecting to be able to just walk in somewhere and start working, but I'm going to make use of it while it lasts."

I work part-time as a coding instructor but it's all online, I need more interaction. I enjoy teaching and am involved in many activities that I find incredibly fun, like playing music and making things, both physical and inside the computer. I really want to find others who share these interests, because I'm building a new career and many mutual opportunities could arise if I could pool my talents with others.\n\nSome compromises obviously must be made while in pursuit of this dream, and this is an extremely awkward time for everyone, so I'm open to any type of lodging at all, even camping possibilities.

It's fast, and you can do it all without ever leaving the newsfeed so you can strengthen the quality of your network without interrupting your flow. You just click on the three little dots on the top-right of their stupid post, and *unfollow* their ass. Super!\n\nAnother tip: Do this while in *recent posts* mode, that way you are most effectively eliminating the ones that are actively posting stupid shit. \n\nThis has been a PSA so we can all stop spending hours sorting through profiles trying to figure out whether I even know this person"

While it is a very noble thing to try to educate others, the person must be ready to receive what you are trying to communicate or you will be likely met with unexpected results. This can be extremely difficult especially if they are family or close friends, but there are most likely better ways you could be spending your time and energy.\n\n2. Don't call them a racist! This is unproductive, lacking in compassion, and will actually completely backfire and drive them deeper into their corner. No one ever said, \"Hmm, that person on the internet just called me a racist, so I think I'm gonna take a long hard think about myself\".\n\nWhat *do* you say? I'm afraid I don't know!

He said that the job of a producer is to assist in the creation of something so unique, that no one could ever possibly recreate it.\n\nThen for some reason, at the end of the playlist, on came \"Born in the USA\". Some people in the room overheard, and we all shared a moment of wonder, laughing quite a bit at how repetitive the lyrics were. What was he even talking about? Why is he so proud to be born in the USA, and why the need to scream it so passionately like 87 times?\n\nPerhaps you had to be there. The song turned into kind of a running joke in my home, which led me to sit down to learn it. Still, I had found it more entertaining to preserve the lyrical ambiguity of the song (as well as our running joke) through willful ignorance than to bother trying to read and analyze it.\n\nNow that the lockdown protesters have brought the song into the news with a much more embarrassing failure of interpretation, my curiosity can at last be put to rest.\n\nGod bless this great nation."

I'm currently maintaining the Exercism Clojure track and helping out as well with Racket, Emacs Lisp, Bash, Python, and starting today - I am beginning to launch my very own language track: Babashka!\n\nBabashka is a language similar to Clojure, but runs inside Bash. This enables a new level of expressiveness and data processing for many system tasks.\n\nYour support is much appreciated as this is 100% volunteer work, and it is my hope that this material will help people build new careers in this time of unprecedented uncertainty."

He's a really good dog. And a really good robot.\n\nThe conversion of the pixel art to vector paths and polygons has been drastically improved, preserving the retro look with zero distortion, much more optimized output code, and since it is all done programmatically... I don't need to use Inkscape anymore!!!!"

OMG that was a nightmare... actually input that over the last couple months in Portland while on the street - it's how I would pass the time when my laptop battery was dead, but trying to use this ancient music interface (an Android port of an SDL port of a DOS program from 1991) on such a horrible device (my free gov't \"smrtphone\" that crashes while you're in the middle of dialing) became an excruciating test of will. for the magnitude of frustration generated as a side effect of this task was nearly sufficient at times to yield a critical mass, a potentially deadly concentration of discontent unable to be contained within a human skull. Was cool to get to do the vocals at home on the computer for a change, instead of making a spectacle of myself by screaming into my phone in the middle of the night over the sound of traffic. Did way too many vocal tracks actually. Layering like 12 voices sounds like a good idea, but quickly turns into a pile of garbage if you're not careful."

It came out in 1992 and featured the NES Mouse for drawing graphics, and ended up spawning a real cultural phenomenon that is actually still unfolding - just check out all the videos of songs made with Mario Paint Composer, which was a Windows program (and later a web application) that expanded upon the music editor and reached a level of infectious popularity due to what I believe to be a winning combination of interactive approachability and a highly sensible choice of features in a friendly design that maximally encourages exploration, making a new level of creative expression through audiovisual media accessible to a whole generation.\n\nI'm not the only one continually delighted by this thing. I Just happened to come across a nice article that expresses very well the magnitude of artistic synergy made possible by effectively bringing together music composition, pixel art and animation into a well designed interface, producing a powerful multimedia design suite with cool sounds, pretty colors, and cute characters.\n\nHere's a paper providing a comprehensive analysis by a professor of Chiptune music: https://www.academia.edu/17232607/Mario_Paint_An_Accessible_Environment_of_Musical_Creativity_and_Sound_Exploration\n\nAnd since we so love academic papers oozing with music nerdy goodness, here's an awesome explanation of one of the main technological areas in which I intend to improve - by raising the standard for interactive, dynamically rendered music notation, meeting the high quality and precision demanded by the tradition of sheet music engraving, while pushing the user interface so far that I think it ought to define its own new little form of media that I'm calling \"Music Animation\".\n\nMusic Animation... sounds kinda weird, doesn't it? The words seem to not quite fall together, leaving a bit of a conceptual vacuum when you wonder why it isn't it more of a thing. How could it be that these primary forms of artistic expression don't seem to be so often used in a more complimentary fashion? One form tends to most often serve to enhance the other, we have tons of visual art, whether it's graphical, performance, gaming, etc. in which music is an undeniably critical piece, and it's easy to imagine the opposite too - the use of multimedia displays, dancing, etc. to provide a visual context and enhanced sensory experience to music theater. But what about allowing them to truly play together? I think we could just be missing a whole field of entertainment here, the celebration of the structural beauty of music composition when it is fully *brought to life* -- Music Animation.\n\nOne possible reason for this void that I have come to realize through this project is very much technological. Music notation, the effective graphical representation of rhythms, melodies and harmonies over time, turns out to be a way harder, more intricate problem than one would expect. The long tradition of music engraving is a colossal gallery of complicated edge and corner cases amounting to a big enough graphical layout challenge to produce a typographical design nightmare. Reading music is really hard. And if one thing is just slightly off, you'll have musicians squinting their eyes in confusion.\n\nThroughout the migration of the art of music engraving into the digital world, we have witnessed once again the destructive power of proprietary technology, and the extent to which innovation can be halted when a field becomes dominated by companies with a specific interest in keeping it from the public. This is why I think we currently have so much room to grow in the areas of music design, presentation and archival. We have found ourselves buried in a horrible mess of incompatible formats, a useless duplication of human effort. This is the case in pretty much every corner of music education and production - you've got the various \"Digital Audio Workstations\", each with its own (usually terrible) interface, nearly always running on some proprietary platform, imprisoning all our hard work in a tragic fashion that will only transfer to future platforms with great difficulty if at all. For graphical notation, we have failed to advance at a pace comparable to other forms of culture due to the only acceptable implementations confined to the domain of programs like Sibelius and Finale, each with their own system that will never be able to communicate with any other, or to allow the fruits of our creative efforts to progress freely, evolving into possibly new forms of media\n\nIt seems however, in a nice twist of optimism, that we as a society are beginning to get this. Progress-stifling greed will not be going away anytime soon, but the message is becoming loud and clear that we need to work together to advance as a civilization, through the free sharing of ideas."

At that point his mental state seemed rather questionable in my totally unprofessional estimation, but he quickly snapped out of it when he noticed me.\n\n\"Nice hair,\" he said.\n\"Thanks\", I replied.\n\"And hat...\" he continued. \"...and backpack.\"\nClearly he had good taste in backpacks at least.\n\"Don't mind me... I like to talk to my bear sometimes.\"\n\"That's cool...\" I said. \"I used to have one kinda like that, kept it since I was 2.\"\n\n\"I just got this one, so it's kinda like I was just born,\" he told me, his eyes beaming with excitement. \"In fact,\" he continued, \"I just learned object permanence a little while ago, when I looked away and at first thought he was gone, and looked back and there he was again!\"\n\nAt this point our train had been curiously stopped for awhile. Then suddenly a bunch of police cars surrounded us and immediately came aboard. I admittedly freaked for a good moment thinking maybe they were coming for me for some mistaken reason (wouldn't be the first time).\n\n\"Sir?\" they called in my direction, causing my blood pressure to spike until I realized it was my new friend they were after.\n\n\"We received information that you are carrying a weapon. If that is true we will deal with it, if not you'll be free to go once we make sure, but first you just need to comply so we can get off of this train.\"\n\nTurned out he did have a Tanto blade. He interacted with them  completely politely and they took him away, then our train resumed course.\n\nThey made sure to grab all his stuff, including the teddy bear. They did, however, leave behind his bus pass, which I grabbed as a memento.\n\nThis post is simply intended as an example of a rather typical day in Portland from my perspective.

You should keep working on this and try to do something with it, like prepare a talk for the next conference.\"\n\nI thanked him for the encouraging words.\n\n\"You had made it sound like you haven't done much.

        "post": "I prepared a comprehensive response to my potential job in Denmark - but haven't sent it yet.... I want to make sure it's good first. Feedback most appreciated! Is it too long? What should I add/remove? Typos? It contains a bio of my journey into programming, all the way from childhood tinkering to my grand motivation for choosing the career and technologies, to the frustrations of trying to get into a competitive industry with only a resume and portfolio of personal projects. Time to work some magic with some persuasive writing? I'm attempting to win them over by pulling out my strongest quasi-visionary tactics. Let me know if you think I should change anything.\n\nHi <Potential Employer>,\n\nThank you for taking the time to reply. It is not often that I find a company looking for a junior Clojure dev, which is understandable given that folks who use Clojure tend to be some of the most experienced in the industry, and very much sought after for the exceptional productivity they have honed throughout their career. It's a small pond, but with an intimidatingly formidable competition. By all means, take as much time as you need to assess your situation and consider your options. In the meantime though, I thought I would provide a more detailed, casual introduction. I'd like to explain a bit how I arrived here, and why I am so excited about the possibility of relocating to be part of a Clojure team. \n \nMy personal computing history actually goes back to DOS and BASIC in my childhood on an IBM XT, my father's old business machine. I made simple games in BASIC that targeted the Speech Thing, one of the first consumer-level text-to-speech systems. I learned to write batch files and solve problems for my dad, who used it for database management and desktop publishing for his mail-order tool company. I struggled to piece everything together from magazine articles, as one did before the days of the modern internet. But I had no one to come to with questions or to receive feedback or guidance, so could only go so far, and went on to pursue other things.\n \nMy main inspiration for programming as a career started in 2015 with Python. I was studying mathematics, music and psychology at the time, but ended up spending more time trying to fix my computer, and sought help from my college's makerspace. They set me up with a Raspberry Pi 3, and I was so impressed with it that I got rid of all my other systems and used it as my only computer for an entire year. I felt that we were entering a new age of computing where once again users were encouraged to tinker with their systems, use the command-line and learn programming languages, but this time the field had matured to be fundamentally different: Not only do we have access to a myriad of online language communities, unified knowledge bases with answers to nearly all my questions, centralized repositories for code discovery and social networks for sharing our work, but I caught a glimpse of the endless possibilities for applications to be applied to every other field, and became convinced that software development has become the predominant vehicle for technological advancement. As an educator, however, I recognize above all the incredible potential for software to radically change the way that we learn. When I realized all this I understood that developing a proficiency in application design would be the most valuable investment one could make to increase productivity by orders of magnitude in any domain.\n \nI was learning Python but needed to come up with a first project. I needed to make something useful, that would solve some problem. So my first real app became a simple GUI spreadsheet app to help me play a city-builder simulation game in which the strategy involved keeping track of a lot of data. I was playing the game and realized that I could gain a strategic advantage by writing a program to help me track inventory and optimize production. The challenge of the game was based on our limited human ability to make sense of complex data and make educated decisions based on its analysis, and I saw an opportunity to overcome that limitation through writing a simple program. It worked so well that it felt like I was cheating, but it ended up teaching me a much deeper lesson about how to recognize where our psychology breaks down and how it can be effectively complemented to gain critical insight.\n \nI also had a funny feeling that I would eventually come to look at my code and laugh, since I was writing individual functions for each item, amounting to nearly 1000 lines of Python (which I now know that I could probably do in a couple dozen lines of Clojure), and that my path in choosing the right technologies and developing effective habits had just begun.\n \nMy decision to use Clojure represents what I believe to be the most significant indicator of my path as a programmer, and in a language community full of people who are better than me, I'm counting on this being the piece that demonstrates to my future employer the kind of developer that I have the potential to become, as evidenced by the technologies and practices that I have come to use. For it was not a casual decision or an accident of circumstance that brought me here. My future team will see that I possess a quality of discernment to choose the most efficient and practical tools available, to not be swayed by the popular alternatives that gain users based on hype, and to carefully weigh the inherent benefits and risks involved in choosing a technology, in light of the ecosystem and community with which it comes bundled. My arrival to Clojure was the result of a very deep and careful survey of the history and landscape of paradigms and platforms, and very much guided by my experience as an educator. Having read SICP,, I developed an affinity with Lisp, in its Scheme incarnation. I installed DrRacket on my Raspberry Pi and learned Racket using the HtDP text. But this was all purely academic, to learn to be a better programmer. I never imagined writing that kind of code to build real apps, but was blown away when I saw that Clojure was one of the 8 languages supported by Heroku (thanks to Phil Hagelberg).\n \nEvery moment I've spent with Clojure since has been overwhelmingly positive. My first Clojure project was a tool to do 4clojure problems from the terminal. I learned basic i/o, error handling and database scraping. Then, as a fan of simple puzzle games, I made an implementation of Minesweeper that runs in the terminal which I am still iterating on, now a complete Reagent app in Clojurescript.\n \nNow, however, I have begun focusing mostly on JavaScript and plain React, along with the standard web-stack, both in an effort to better learn the host infrastructure, and to expand my employment opportunities. I believe that the habits that I've developed by getting the chance to learn from such gifted and generous individuals in the Clojure community has given me an incredible advantage. No other language has key players like Mike Fikes or Bruce Hauman... who follow me on twitter and will personally answer my questions! But finding any entry-level Clojure work has been a long struggle. I even took part in Eric Normand's Clojure career workshop, and was given some great leads, but could not make up for the fact that I was vastly inexperienced compared to my competition.\n \nI got frustrated for awhile and took a break from Clojure, and wrote a text editor in C for which I later enabled Clojure syntax highlighting and simple eval via Planck. And I wrote a music synthesizer in Bash which helped me get a solid handle on shell scripting, which ends up being indispensable in every project at some point. I had decided that Clojure, while a great language, was just not practical enough. The only thing that kept me with it, was that I had an Introduction to Clojure talk to prepare to give at LinuxFest Northwest, for which I was to play the role of the Clojure evangelist!\n \nI ended up being sufficiently persuasive for at least one individual - myself. If I hadn't had to give the talk I might have moved on, but it was such a positive experience that I ended up convincing myself to stick with it, and gave a (much better) presentation the following year.\n \nThen a miracle happened. I ended up getting called back for a position in England with a relocation package. After the interview, they immediately called me back... to invite me to the team! Since they got a curiously low number of applicants, my resume stood out. But since I had little experience, they decided to create a Junior Clojure position just for me! Finally it all paid off, I had landed my dream job, and was on my way to move across the world!\n \nThen a bunch of time went by and I didn't hear anything from them. I started to wonder why. Then they finally informed me that there had been a mistake, and it turned out that their advert had not been displayed through the proper channels, and was to be rerun. After many months of suspense, I was regretfully informed that they had received applications from some very accomplished developers, and were forced by the powers that be to accept them before me.\n \nI congratulated them. That's good, right? They deserve to hire the best talent out there. But the more proficient I become with Clojure, the more I wonder what value I could have brought to them in the long-term. Or what avenues for Clojure education could have been brought forth as the result of building a team consisting of a healthy balance of skill levels. This is the value that will be recognized by my team, when the time is right.\n \nI spend a lot of time thinking about the growth of Clojure, and why it remains in its humble place in the general development landscape despite its clear advantages. Its apparent barriers to adoption are indeed a disturbing point for many, and often the beginner experience is cited as the likely culprit. This may be true, and I say, admittedly at the risk of being totally self-serving, that the answer is simple: If we want new developers to come to Clojure, we need to create jobs for them! And hire them!  \n \nThank you so much for your honest consideration. I'm confident of your judgement and have no expectations. I wish for your company much success, and most importantly, to enjoy what you do every step along the way.\n \nBest wishes,\nBobby Towers\n \nP.S. Yeah, Just Juxt was an idea that came out of my workshop with Eric Normand, and was suggested during the Apropos show, which had a bit of a running joke about solving every problem using juxt. It was my first project using multiple APIs (github and twitter) and a challenge in fetching code, parsing it and preparing it into published content for which I'm still in the midst of finding a sweet spot for maximal education and entertainment value. I'm currently trying to figure out how to automate the tweets in such a way that will not get boring or annoying once the novelty wears off. So until I find a good system of intelligently curating the juxts and posting at optimal intervals, I feel that it is a project better suited for human curation. So I used it as an opportunity to go really crazy, and made a blog where I broke down a different solution with juxt every day. I had lots of free time and it got a lot of attention from Planet Clojure and in Daniel Compton's newsletter, who found it particularly inspiring. It was a blast seeing just how long I could keep a daily blog going. I made it 46 days before I ran out of juxts!"

        "post": "The Thalamus, Web Frameworks and the Neurobiology of Software\n\nThis is my response to a soon-to-be-released article by Daniel Higginbotham, author of Clojure for the Brave and True https://www.braveclojure.com/. He posted on Twitter that he very much wanted some feedback before publishing it, so this is what he got:\n\nCool! So to put my perspective in context, the ~3 years of playing with Clojure makes up the bulk of my programming experience. It seems a rarity for folks to pick Clojure to start with, but that's what I did. It was Clojure Brave that contributed greatly to this decision, so I'm very happy to be involved in your work. You'll have to forgive *me* for responding a little rambly, but hopefully my rambles will be somewhat indicative of the article's coherence which is your inquiry.\n \nFor one thing, I've never made a rails app. But now I kinda want to try it just to get the *full* framework experience.... Used Django a bit, I'm guessing it's probably about equally opinionated but less easy. Lots of bloat, with its very creator now running far and fast from all frameworks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvOsegaN9Wk\nAh... but I *am* familiar with how the operating system works (a little), so that's a very nice analogy.\n \nI had assumed that the article was going to be about Duct, but it appears not! Is Duct a framework? Closer, maybe?\n \nEric Normand wants to see a \"boring\" Clojure framework inspired not by Rails but by... Wordpress! https://lispcast.com/clojure-needs-grow-boring-web-framework-boring-data-science/\nWhat would that be like? I kinda want to see that... Maybe take Cryogen and start writing plugins...\n \n> In the Clojure community, one of the unwritten tenets is that frameworks can eat shit. Other languages might need frameworks, but not ours! Libraries all the way, baby!\n \nI feel this sentiment echoed most succinctly from Stuart Sierra in Learning Clojure: Next Steps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbodL96HM28 when he warns us all *not* to make frameworks. Why not? Because, he says, frameworks require a language maturity that Clojure has not yet reached. So here we are like 6 years later. Are we ready yet? \n \n> Another \"problem\" is that Clojure tools like Luminus and the top-rate web dev libraries it bundles provide such a productive experience that frameworks seem superfluous.\n \nIf I understand, you are speaking to the effect that we've gotten so good at composing libraries that we're perhaps missing some major improvements that could be facilitated by a grand-unified system enabled by the framework? As if we're saying \"just glue all the pieces together, what's the problem?\" while failing to notice how much work we're duplicating both on the library level and the project level. \n \nAside: Where does Luminus get off calling itself a framework anyway? What about re-frame? Duct? Coast? Hoplon?  I have a feeling that all of these (while they are great systems) are missing the critical parts that bring the next level of productivity (which you later enumerate as _communication systems_ and _abstractions_). \n \n> Frameworks have second-order benefits, and I'll cover those too. They make it possible for an ecosystem of reusable components to exist.\n \nInteresting... in a way not possible with libraries? I'm a bit skeptical but can't wait to hear how! EDIT: once again, I now get it after reading more. But this is a really good (and somewhat subtle) point, so maybe drill that one in a bit more (you probably do - let me just keep reading)\n \n> A framework is a set of libraries that:\n \n> * Manages the complexity of coordinating the _resources_ needed to write an application\n> * By providing _abstractions_ for those resources\n> * And _systems for communicating_ between those resources\n> * Within an _environment_\n> * So that programmers can focus on writing business logic\n \nSo there they are. I'm thinking about another metaphor, like a complex organism with skeletal, nervous, respiratory, digestive systems, etc. which together form a living being. Or a brain... all the mental faculties combine to cause to emerge an entirely new level of awareness that absolutely cannot be understood by simply analyzing the individual systems. Is it time for the Clojure ecosystem to grow a brain? \n \nAside: drawing from some interesting psychological research - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2857829/ it is conjectured that the \"seat of consciousness\" in the brain may actually be the thalamus - which acts as a kind of central switching hub, a relay center. It seems plausible because it is the one intersection that *all* of the various parts of the brain end up routing through, making it the only possible candidate responsible for producing an integrated sense (or illusion?) of self and our environment.\n \nWent out on a limb there. Perhaps I should just write my own response piece about the neurobiology of software. But anyway... what *is* the thalamus of a web app?\n \nThe usual dichotomy drawn of inversion of control (your *code* calls libraries/frameworks call your code) is conspicuously missing in your definition. EDIT: I see that you do mention this later. I'm sure you have good reasons for these criteria. But at first glance they seem more \"slippery\", i.e. I could kinda make a case for \"set of libraries X\" being a framework. EDIT: but after reading the whole article it makes perfect sense (or maybe I just have an uncanny capacity for self-delusion?), that it needs to provide *all* of them, in their full capacities and *cooperating with each other* to support a living being.  I'm curious what is/are the \"missing piece(s)\" that pushes it over the edge. What would have to be added to something like Luminus to make it a framework? That is, if it is indeed possible, a question I think you raise later.\n \nAh, here we go:\n \n> Frameworks make these decisions for us, allowing us to focus on business logic, and they do so by introducing _communication systems_ and _abstractions_.\n \nSee, every time you answer my questions if I just keep reading. I think I'm starting to get it, nice!\n \nBTW, Joyent's Bryan Cantrill has an absolutely superb history and explanation of the pipe and unix philosophy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0mviKhVmBI I spoke about this during a Clojure talk I gave at LinuxFest Northwest, because I notice a common theme here - composability. Bryan then says that 4 decades later, this still remains the single biggest innovation in software systems thinking.\n \nBut you are asking for us to take it a step further - and perhaps add the *file system* to Clojure? \n \n> By contrast, the presence of a communication broker can make life much easier. In the Clojure world, the React frameworks re-frame and om.next have embraced global state atoms, a kind of communication broker similar to the filesystem (atoms are an in-memory storage mechanism). They also both have well defined communication protocols. I'm not very familiar with Redux but I've heard tell that it also has embraced a global, central state container.\n \nYes, that's it! The thalamus! The universal crossover point that forms the source (or illusion) of truth.\n \n> If you accept my assertion that an operating system is a framework, then you can consider any program which communicates via one of the OS's communication systems (sockets, the file model, etc) to be an extension of the framework. Postgres is a framework extension that adds an RDBMS resource. statsd is an extension that adds a monitoring resource.\n \nI was sort of conceiving them as a heirarchy of interacting sub-frameworks, but I'm not sure if that really adds anything to the discussion besides confusion. For example, Ring is an http abstraction that coordinates the communication within its environment. Could that make Ring an *http framework*? Clojure.test is a *testing framework*, because it coordinates the communication between your functions and their tests in the environment of you program.\n \nWrapping up, you've made a case for frameworks that has genuinely transformed my thinking. Contrast Rich Hickey's insightful though puzzling musical instrument analogy to the A.N. Whitehead quote he gives in \"Are we there yet\":\n \n\"Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking of them.\"\n \nFor that... we're gonna need some frameworks!"

It was honestly too outrageous to fully believe, until he proved it by digging up a mix tape from 1999 with my song on it!\n\nI told this story, of writing a hit song and not getting credit for it, to my music professor who owns a record label, and she asked, shocked, \"What are you doing about that?\"\n\nI didn't know what to say. What can I do? How do I get paid for this? I need me some of that Internet Money\u00e2\u0084\u00a2...\n\nYou can help by buying the single: https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/bitchesonacid\n\nOr check out the full debut album, @[509855932427215:274:Bombastic Dubstep] on your favorite online music store:\nhttps://music.apple.com/us/album/bombastic-dubstep-2013/694192215\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Bombastic-Dubstep-2013/dp/B00ESXIHE6\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/7BD4LSki0D0hvymTABty3g\nhttps://play.google.com/music/m/Bldaiyj3ynjk7xetih4pg5yzhb4?t=Bombastic_Dubstep_2013_-_Bombastic_Dubstep\n\nAnd for the truly hardcore, stay up to date on all the unreleased material:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/boacid"

Get used to it.\n\nI thought I had gone to school for the wrong things. A music career didn't work out for whatever reasons. So then I studied psychology, not because I could ever possibly imagine being the guy with the couch, but because I felt that life must be lived with the fullest possible understanding of how we think.\n\nIn the entirety of my 4 years in college, there is one moment that takes the cake: We were learning about the flawed manner in which we recall events through memory, how every time we retrieve a previous experience it is actually re-encoded, and the implications this could have in the legal system. Should eyewitness testimonies really be trusted if we have the proven capacity to recall false memories? The question was asked to the class, and I raised my hand.\n\n\"It's kind of like that episode of South Park, where every time Cartman has a flashback, it gets more and more obnoxiously far-fetched.\"\n\n\"Um... well, you're talking about a cartoon...\", she mumbled, seeming like I ought to feel embarrassed for wasting their time or something.\n\n\"Yeah...\", I acknowledged, \"but I feel like it reveals a kind of truth that we could learn from. I have here a quote from Oliver Sacks...\"\n\n\"Oh I love Oliver Sacks...\", she perked up, her whole demeanor shifted as I eagerly flipped through my notebook.\n\n\"Every act of perception, is to some degree an act of creation, and every act of memory is to some degree an act of imagination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\n\"Would you have a minute to speak to me after class?\" she asked after a brief moment. \"I wanna talk to you about Oliver Sacks.\"\n\nInstant teacher's pet. At least, that's how I remember the conversation.\n\nBut it turns out that this education was good for more than pleasant memories to post on Facebook. It just so happens that psychology is a vital component of software user-interface design, since we are designing systems for other people to use. And what do I do about my music? Write programs for making music!\n\nBut this isn't supposed to be about me. The point I'm trying to make is, embrace technology. You're on a computer right now, it's how we're doing *everything*. No matter what it is you do, I am 100% sure that there's a way that your workflow could be better optimized.\n\n\"Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking of them.\" - Alfred North Whitehead"

I'm gonna price it out and do some CAD drawings. If this sounds interesting, you could totally be hooked up with a prototype to check out. Models can also be made with e-ink screens!"

What have I done?\n\nMaybe in a certain sense we are all my poor dumb Mario, just walking in whatever direction we are pointed without knowing why. We must seek out the wisdom to perceive obstacles in our path and alter our destiny.\n\nMILESTONE #2 (see below): Jump and stomp that gumba!

Some have used the \"neural network\" approach, an evolution-like process where successful strategies are \"bred\" based on the results of repeated attempts. While they have gotten some fascinating results, I want my program to receive its \"training\" in tiny successive phases and post the results each time a new milestone is reached. Success will not be reached through extensive trail and error, but through the construction of carefully designed heuristics.\n\nFirst I had to figure out how to even begin such a thing. Is that even possible? How can a program interact with the game? It has to react in real time, which means we need a way for it to receive information from the game so it can provide the appropriate controller input based on whatever criteria we set.\n\nIt turns out to be way easier than I thought, because once you are playing a console game inside an emulator, you're already halfway there. You are able to read the contents of the game's memory as it runs, and output the relevant values to our script, which is written in Lua. Each byte in memory is responsible for a certain thing, like Mario's location on the screen.\n\nThe script will define the bot's behavior, which we will incrementally refine as we go. The training process is highly subjective, this project is intended to be highly exploratory... and fun!"

One thing that was pretty obvious is that any great game MUST have a killer soundtrack. Which leads me to this week's question: What is your favorite video game music? But let's make it harder by limiting it to... just the NES! Based on your answers, I'll pick one to use for a very special project.\n\nThe NES has just five sound channels, two for melodies with variable pulse width, a triangle wave generator for the bass, and a noise generator for drums. The 5th one plays low-quality digital samples.\n\nFun fact: The composer's original submission for the Mega Man soundtrack was rejected, because they said it sounded \"too cute\" and \"not cool enough\". I guess he fixed it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDC4X8Dgxr4"

The approach will be to really assume no prior experience other than that you know how to operate your computer.\n\nBut first... we need to play some video games. Very little of the mind is conscious, so in order to solve real problems we will use gaming to tap into the unconscious mind and unlock our full potential.  (citation needed) So we'll begin by setting up a complete retro-gaming system using Emulation Station, DosBox and ScummVM so we can play all our old games, everything from Dig Dug to Prince of Persia to Mario to Day of the Tentacle.\n\nI'll be using a Raspberry Pi 3 (which costs $35), partly because if you can get something working on that it will most likely run on anything, and I'll be explaining everything in detail, right from installing the operating system and software. You'll be able to follow along on whatever system you have, with minor adjustments which we'll try to cover along the way, and even delve into some awesome things you can do on a cheap smartphone!\n\nVideos will be posted on my YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/BobbyTowers\n\nAll videos will be accompanied by an article posted on my blog:\nhttp://crjunkie.blogspot.com/\n\nAnd lastly, all source code we use will be available on github:\nhttps://github.com/porkostomus\n\nIf you would like to help contribute to the sustainable production of quality content, you can become a patron:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/porkostomus"

A Raspberry Pi isn't gonna spin up Adobe anything, even if I wanted to use that crap. But that's quite alright, because what is a video, really? Words and pictures. In other words... a glorified slideshow.\n\nI can make a video without actually using a camera, because I can create digital images and string them together. I can speak without using my voice and record audio with no mic, because I can compose text and have the computer turn it into audio.\n\nI've effectively abstracted away the entirely of the content from the presentation, leaving behind the latter's potential limitations and inefficiencies.\n\nSo after my body dies and my brain is kept alive in a jar and/or my consciousness is digitized and uploaded to the cloud, I'll still be able to make YouTube videos!"

You can wait for it to become responsive or kill it.\n\nPLANS FOR 2018!\nFor a couple of years now I've been very careful not to talk about my plans, in order to avoid \"premature congratulation\", as part of an effort to be someone who DOES things instead of just talking about them.\nBut lately I've been thinking that this is a mistake! Why?\n\nSimple - it eliminates the chance of potentially valuable community feedback and collaboration.\n\nWhat if a killer team could have come together based on similar motivations and complementary skills, but was precluded because the idea wasn't expressed?\n\nWhat if it was actually a dumb idea and isn't really worth the time, which ends up being wasted because nobody told me it was a dumb idea? Often we may think we have come up with something amazing, but through the process of putting it into words we discover, perhaps not so much. \n\nBut I still think New Years resolutions are stupid. If they help you, good job keep it up, but I'm simply gonna announce what I call \"plans for 2018\":\n\nI want to start blogging regularly and producing quality audiovisual content. Not committing to a strict schedule though, because I'm shooting for a more polished level this time, but the idea to keep tight hold of is to always be maximizing the social aspect of whatever I'm doing. Because in a major sense, any effort is missing the mark unless it is a shared experience, in which seeds are planted for us all to learn from and expand upon. The future, as a community we will build. As a super-organism.  What will we grow into? What will we become? It's time for... a metamorphosis.\n\n\"Plans for 2018\" installed successfully.\nYou need to restart the system for these changes to come into effect...\nHAPPY NEW YEAR!"

That's really just a fancy way of asking, \"How far is it in each direction?\"\n\nSo I made that function and parsed the directions into a sequence of steps and turns, and then appropriately incremented or decremented my coordinates according to the direction of travel, determined by dividing the value of the number of turns by 4 and taking the remainder.

Instead of relying on prerecorded samples, you learn to produce all of the music yourself from the pure sonic building blocks by tuning the specific variables.\n\nI'm doing this because the world needs more people making music. Like everyone! I agree strongly with Daniel Levitin who explains in his book This Is Your Brain On Music that a much unfortunate and unique phenomenon has happened in our culture where we have taken on the perception that you have to be talented to do art. Compared to other activities, it is pretty absurd that we should demand such a high level of aptitude just to be considered acceptable. If you cannot prepare a meal like a master chef, do you not cook dinner? If you cannot play a sport like the pros, should you not be able to enjoy a game with your friends?\n\nWith all the impressive advances in software sequencers and virtual instruments, I believe we can be doing a whole lot more to put powerful music creation tools into the hands of people of every skill level. That's what this platform is all about!\n\nWant to know more? Feel free to visit the page and get involved!\nhttp://overtone.github.io/\nhttp://supercollider.github.io/"

That sucks, but you didn't even know I had a guitar because I hadn't even gotten around to telling you yet. It's a shame to have to find out like this, going along with this post's rather crude nature, when the emotional depth and full impact of the situation can only be expressed in the full context of a couple other major life events - the loss of the use of my fretting hand, and my grandma's recent passing. Recent as in the other day. Yes, what a bother to find out like this.\n\nBefore going to sleep, I wisely thought to secure my new guitar by tying it to myself. I wasn't concerned about people with malicious tendencies lurking about, this was just an extra precaution to prevent a passerby from thinking \"oh that's a nice looking guitar, I think I'll grab that\". They didn't bother untying the cable though - instead they cut it off of me with wire cutters. Yuck.... feels so much like piss all over my face.\n\nI had finally saved up enough to get a decent acoustic guitar. I hadn't really played guitar in a couple years, because it was too frustrating trying to learn it lefty. But I can still play keyboards just fine, so it was easier to just go with that. But ever since my harmonium was stolen over 6 months ago, I'd been without any instruments. An essential part of my self expression and livelihood missing, I found it easier to occupy myself with other things to fill the creative void, like computer programming, and that turned out to be one of the most exciting developments in my life. But just last week, I decided it was time to start making music again... I wanted to get a GUITAR. To face the one thing that I still feel like I lost - since my accident 2 years ago I have been dodging the tragic reality that I will never play guitar again, at least anything like how I used to. I wanted to force myself to face it, and actually learn to play it left-handed no matter how difficult.\n\nIt didn't quite work out that way - because after a few days, I realized I can totally play slide guitar! With a couple days' practice, I found myself able to play anything I wanted to, as well as I ever could! It was such a breakthrough... \n\nMusic was suddenly back in my life. And then I found out that my grandma had passed away, who was the greatest musical influence in my family. The timing was so right I wanted to ask the cosmos if they were fucking with me.\n\nI spent all day yesterday setting up the guitar for slide. I fashioned my own custom piece to raise the string action out of the plastic outside of a magic marker using nothing but a lighter and a pack of emery boards. I was so proud of myself, it turned out perfectly and sounded so amazing! And my playing was so solid I was suddenly experiencing the healing of my deepest emotional wounds.\n\nBut now it's gone... some asshole crouched over me with wire cutters and removed it from my person, and metaphorically peed all over me. \n\nThere will be more guitars though. \n\nI love my grandma.\n\nRIP Ruth Towers"

During my time at The Challenger Street Newspaper in Austin, I saw the power of a publication produced authentically by the community to offer the voice of the streets, a scene that I believe to be a sign of a healthy, vibrant culture. \n\nWhat does a healthy community look like? \nPEOPLE HANGING OUT, OUTSIDE!\n\nWhoa... all those homeless people... GROSS! What can we do about them? Where can we shuffle them off too?\n\nImagine that maybe, people sometimes congregate outdoors and socialize, do various business and participate in the advancement of humanity.\n\nFear and disgust of normal human behavior come from lack of knowledge, and this is where a street paper strikes so effectively. In order to move forward, we need to realize that we are a SUPERORGANISM, that our cooperative actions have the power to multiply individual efforts into long-term social change. To do this we need to expand the \"I\".\n\nWho am I? My basic model of self-awareness tells me that I am most likely a sack of meat that can make decisions, even advanced long-term goal-oriented  ones. But the bigger truth that we are on the path towards internalizing is that we are all expressions of humanity on planet Earth, transforming our surroundings through our creative potential.\n\nTake a moment to delight in getting to know someone \"different\" who you don't understand - and try to realize that they are YOU.\n\nThis is such a simple concept, yet it begins to smell of spiritual mumbo jumbo, social justice warriorism, or neo-Jungian Quantum flap-doodle, but I'm just trying to loosen our social bubbles and release the echos from the chambers that divide us from other groups whom we perceive as different and thus whatever degree of objectionable our subconscious responds with.\n\nLooking at all of human history we have come so far... but psychological evolution lags behind by something like 10,000 years if I remember correctly. In other words, our minds are still adapted to the world as it was 10,000 years ago.\n\nThat means that people living in houses could be considered a FAD. We have completely transformed the world to suit a new way of life that we don't understand at all..."

Have to wait 'till Monday to see my professors again, but I've got a great vision about something I could do here! \n\nIt's called: \"Adieu, Sweet Barbary Allen\", an animated folk/rock opera based on the classic Scottish/Irish love ballad.\n\nI came up with the idea last year, perplexed by my own obsession with this amazing song... like the Romeo and Juliet story, but harder hitting in some ways that I'm still exploring.  I realized that it would be perfect for an opera, with the verses of the song serving as a recurring motif connecting a series of original musical compositions that advance the plot and take us through some interesting twists.\n\nThat sounds rather ambitious... but here's the kicker: I've got all the songs written already! 9 of them, and half are already recorded!\n\nIt's true... as I went through my own discography I was shocked to only learn now that ALMOST EVERY SONG I'VE WRITTEN IS (or could be interpreted as) A LOVE TRAGEDY! I went through them last night and laid out a storyboard for a new album and animated film to produce HERE, at the college as a collaborative project. It begs to be part of the curriculum, because it grew directly from its heart: The History of American Folk.\n\nI wasn't even particularly excited about the course because I'm not that into Folk music so naturally it sounded kinda boring. But I was in for a huge surprise. The music professor gave us a brilliant tour of the genesis of American music showcasing how the songs evolved through the Folk *process*, and this tune as sung by Jean Ritchie was so gorgeous I practically melted into my seat: https://youtu.be/9l3VePGR-QA\n At the time, I was intensely learning some new electronic music production software, so I got the crazy idea to put \"The Blues\" back into dance music by making Folk-Dubstep! \n\nThis is what came about, made with Logic Pro 9 and MASSIVE. I lifted the vocals straight from the a cappela video below and simply formed a modern musical setting around them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQzVAFyQbYk\n\nThe track was a huge success, and emerges as a shining representation of the \"Folk Process\" still at work, perpetuated by our modern interpretations of the classics. I can see this project as a way to unify the whole curriculum. It's history, theory, performance, drama and multimedia. The animation department is even right in the music wing!\n\nIt's wonderful to be back. I could definitely do some stuff here."

It has only been 2 days and the goal is still distant, but this gofundme campaign has already been a success! Here's a full breakdown of where we stand, and how I plan to use the funds this week:\n\nThe 3D printer will probably have to wait. The model I am looking at is the Monoprice Select Mini. It is $214.50 on Amazon and has great reviews, which I think is incredible! I listed it as part of the proposal because it will be the ideal production method for the enclosures, but the logical order of design will be to put that on the back burner for now and focus on the electronics first, since a laptop case can be improvised should the goal fail to be met. After all, better to have a working prototype with no case, than a nice looking case that doesn't do anything!\n\nComponents already on hand: Raspberry Pi 3, USB keyboard and mouse. In order to create a working unit, we need to order a screen and the parts to build the driver board.\n\nGood news: The ereader display is only $18.90 on ebay! This will be the first thing to get. Then we have the most challenging part - the circuit board and components, and the tools to solder everything. It uses surface mount components which are typically installed by robots, but this can reasonably be done by hand so that's how we roll. Let's break it down:\n\nCircuit board must be ordered in a minimum quantity of 3, which is $30.15. Components will cost around $25. Then I just need to figure out the most practical and economical way to connect them to the board. The most common way to do this is with solder paste and a reflow oven, or a heat gun. But I'm gonna try it with a regular iron by simply globbing it on and removing the excess with copper wicking. It will require lots of patience, a steady hand and possibly magnification.\n\nSo the bottom line is, we're pretty much in business! I can order this stuff this week, and we'll see how the campaign continues to unfold! Thanks everyone!"

I'll be putting together a crowdfunding campaign, but first I'd like to find a couple of \"casual\" supporters, so I can get some tools and supplies to build a prototype as a proof of concept.\n\nThere is currently no affordable device that offers this functionality which addresses two important issues - battery life, and eye strain. Backlit displays are harsh on the eyes and limit productivity, drain your batteries, and are useless in sunlight.\n\nMy original idea was to hack a Nook or a Kindle (which run Android) to use it as a remote desktop, but this requires WiFi - a big drawback. Imagine a device that would be completely useless without being connected to a network - unacceptable as a marketable solution. The better option is to reverse-engineer a driver for an e-ink display, and I have found a way to do it for about $50. That's $25 for the screen, and $25 for the parts to build the driver. \n\nWhat do you guys think? I really wanna make this thing! Once I get the electronics working, I can get to the fun part of designing a beautiful case and putting it all together. It will basically look like a netbook, a small clamshell-type hinged laptop with a physical keyboard suitable for serious typing. And of course, it will come in pretty colors!"

I'm really excited and hopeful for an opportunity to gather some much needed interest (maybe even venture-capital? Now let's not get THAT hopeful...).\n\nKeeping with my custom of casting all my half-baked ideas to YOU first, my dear Facebookers, I shall now present my vision: \n\nI feel that we are now at a technological crossroads of a magnitude that has not happened since 1976, when the very first home computers were put together in the garages of Silicon Valley, and I'm imagining this meetup group to be the 2017 version of the Homebrew Computer Club, where Steve Wozniak showed up with his work of pure genius made from \"liberated\" computer parts. When his friend Steve Jobs saw this thing, it would eventually be marketed as the original Apple Computer.\n\nYes, Apple totally sucks now, but I've got to find inspiration in their exemplary product development and marketing strategies. In particular, the unique ability to detect a potential widespread application of the emerging innovation and boldly package it as functional tech-art. I've been working on this project for 5 years now, and I think the time is right for it to be released. But I'm gonna need some help... which I hope to recruit tonight - I need to find my Steve Jobs!\n\nSo here's the thing: I'll just spill it all right here and anyone is welcome to steal my idea and make millions off it - then I'll just save my money for the next 10 years till one day I'll have the $200 to be able to buy it from you. \n\nIf it existed, I would stand on the corner and panhandle for it (and I won't even do that for food). But nobody has made this thing, I've looked everywhere, and there are some really cool things deep in the super-nerd-circles, but not even close to what I'm building. And those that are a little bit sorta-close... are all SOLD OUT and unavailable because they can't keep up with the demand!!!\n\nI'm talking about a new kind of computer. Check it out -\n\nThose of you who grew up in the '80s and '90s remember it all. The fullfillment of Bill Gates' dream of a personal computer on every desk in every home. Then in the next 2 decades we sat back and watched that slowly but surely turn into every pocket and every purse. And if you walk into a coffee shop or university, what do you see? Glowing Apples in front of every face. And these new laptops are so freakishly light and thin you could practically use it as a frisbee and float it right over to the Starbucks on the other side of the street. But, damn... are they expensive!\n\nI bought my Macbook Pro in 2013, because I got so fed up with my $700 laptop that I had been using for 10 years, and I had just gone back to school so for the first time had actual shit to get done, that I decided to blow my funding for the entire semester on a new computer, and eat nothing but McDonald's and Ramen noodles for the next 3 months. Just so that for ONCE... I would actually have something that WORKS.\n\nWas it worth it? I thought so. I got Logic Pro and Ableton Live and produced an entire album just in the first month. I learned to do 3D modeling using the same software that South Park uses (ironically, to emulate the classic style of cardboard-cutout animation!). I could have 27 browser tabs open while editing images and video, or run 12 instances of MASSIVE synths making the most disgusting bass noises - but the computer would never, ever even gag on all that sickness. That computer changed my life....\n\nBut not as much as this one.\n\nOops... see, I got so caught up in this here introduction, I seem to have run out of caffeine! I'm gonna post this now and make some coffee. If you've read this far, drop me a comment if you want all the details..."

Yes! Imagine what we could do with electronics mounted in our skulls! The possibilities are endless... but we aren't gonna become cyborgs any time soon. I do have another idea though, that we VERY WELL COULD DEVELOP through this proposed technoganic hybridization:\n\nELECTRONIC STIMULATION OF NEURAL RECEPTORS. This could completely eliminate the need for psychoactive drugs!\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_brain_stimulation\n\nThey already do this in rodent studies, to study the long-term effects of cocaine for example. They don't actually use cocaine! They implant electrodes to stimulate the dopamine receptors, mimicking the effects of the drug. It's still far off from being implemented in humans, but it's definitely possible, and nobody seems to be at all considering the scale of the medical benefits that could be enabled by gaining control of our neurotransmitters without the use of chemicals.\n\nFor sure, don't tell your drug dealer. He'll be out of a job, as will the cartels and the pharmaceutical companies. Think about it! I can imagine in the foreseeable future an individual legitamately suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder or Parkinson's Disease being interfaced with a computerized dopamine regulation mechanism instead of given chemical stimulants like Adderall or Ritalin. Another patient with symtoms of schizophrenia would get the opposite - inhibition of the same neurotransmitters. We will be literally downloading all of our medications directly into our brains to address a huge variety of psychological issues. Software designers could even develop \"recreational drug apps\" that would modify our brain chemistry in creative ways to acheive certain mental states."

But a very nerdy one that particularly excels with personality statistics... providing an unprecedented level of insight into what we individually consider to be life's most important issues. It's a shame that people in general tend to be quite shallow and much of the online relationship discovery marketplace shifted to Tinder and the rest of the \"2nd generation\" dating apps which bring the process of meeting people back closer to the traditional experience - one based on superficial, physical attraction. This article at https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/opinion/sunday/in-defense-of-tinder.html?_r=0 gives a well reasoned explanation in support of the established social paradigm, but I think we are failing to appreciate the tremendous advancement made possible through this expanded access to each other's (hopefully) truthful outlook. I think it represents a major evolution in the way we form relationships that has been made possible by technological innovation enabling enhanced communication.\n\nIt is clear to anyone familiar with OKCupid that their best feature is the match questions. When I realized how powerful they are at sorting personality traits, I spent an incredible amount of time fine-tuning my answers, and in the process made some of the most meaningful lifelong friendships, and also learned a whole lot about MYSELF!  By carefully comparing your answers (which are grouped into lifestyle categories AND ranked by subjective importance), you could often form a freakishly comprehensive prediction of how the two of you get along. Of course there's still the question of relationship chemistry that is only revealed when you meet in person, but the BIG ISSUES, like how compatible you are intellectually, politically, religiously, sexually, etc. are already on the table. Many of us (myself included) discovered through our experience that if you had a high match score with someone, it was almost guaranteed that you had found (at least) a potential BFF.\n\nThis geographical personality analysis of over 600 million responses \"counted how often members in 945 Census-defined Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) gave a particular answer . . . [then] used a statistical method called factor analysis to find patterns based on which responses tend to co-occur in different cities.\"\n\n\"To determine the traits that the responses may signify, we looked at the answers with the largest positive (or negative) point values, and figured out what word or concept best described the pattern we saw. This part\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit subjective, but most will find that the overlap between answers of particular questions certainly makes some clear suggestions about the respondent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality. The factor analysis found that U.S. cities differ along 13 primary personality scales.\""

You can get started with this right away, here's all you need to do (gotta pee? Don't worry, I promise this will be quick):\n\n1. Install Node and NPM\n\n2. Create a project directory and type npm init into your terminal to create a package.json file\n\n3. Use npm to install the React and ReactDOM modules\n\n4. Install babel-core, babel-loader and babel-preset-react to compile JSX into JavaScript\n\n5. Create a babel configuration file named .babelrc containing the following code:\n\n{ presets: ['react'] }\n\n6. Install webpack, webpack-dev-server and html-webpack-plugin\n\n7. Create a webpack configuration file named webpack.config.js with the following code:\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: __dirname + '/app/index.js',\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.js$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        loader: 'babel-loader'\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  output: {\n    filename: 'transformed.js',\n    path: __dirname + '/build'\n  }\n};\n\n8. Configure HTMLWebpackPlugIn by adding the following to the top of webpack.config.js:\n\nvar HTMLWebpackPlugIn = require('html-webpack-plugin');\nvar HTMLWebpackPlugInConfig = new HTMLWebpackPlugIn({\n  template: __dirname + '/app/index.html',\n  filename: 'index.html',\n  inject: 'body'\n});\n\n9. Add the HTMLWebpackPlugin instance to module.exports as the following property:\n\nplugins: [HTMLWebpackPluginConfig]\n};\n\n10. Add the following npm script to package.json:\n\nscripts: {\n  build: \"webpack\",\n  start: \"webpack-dev-server\"\n}\n\n11. Perform webpack transformations by typing:\n\nnpm run build\n\n12. Start a local server with the command:\n\nnpm run start\n\n13. Create a new directory named app inside your root directory containing a file named\nindex.html with the following code:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title Local React App</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"app\"></div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n14. Create index.js with:\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactDOM = require('react-dom');\nvar App =\nrequire('./components/App');\n\nReactDOM.render(\n    <App />,\n     document.getElementById('app')\n );\n    \n15. Create a folder named components inside your app folder. In app/components/App.js, write a component class. This component class can render whatever you want. Don't forget to require React at the top of the file, and to set module.exports equal to your component class at the bottom of the file.\n\n16. In the terminal, type:\n\nnpm run build\n\nThis will create your new html and js files.\n\n17. Type:\n\nnpm run start\n\n18. Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.\n\nCongratulations! Now you can start your project!"

Like the common household items still life painters often choose for their subjects, the clouds of gas, dust, and hot stars pictured here are also commonly found in this setting - a massive, star-forming molecular cloud in the constellation of the Unicorn (Monoceros). The giant molecular cloud, Mon R2, is impressively close, estimated to be only 2,400 light-years or so away.

        "post": "There was a story in the news this week citing a popular psychologist who stated that ADHD was a hoax. My favorite neurologist,  dr. Steven novella responded that it is absolutely not true, it is in fact a very real disorder.\n\nthis was exactly the topic of my final paper for psychology Last Summer. I began the paper with the hypothesis that it was a hoax, but during the course of my research proved myself wrong. I was so happy to hear my conclusion confirmed by someone I respect so highly, I decided to dig up my paper and post it here in its entirety:\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and the Development of Executive Function\n\nRobert J. Towers\nAustin Community College\nIntro to Psychology - Summer 2016\nInstructor: Nancy Bellows\n407B W 35th St, Austin TX 78705\n\nAbstract:\n\nFor research of a psychological\ndisorder, attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder was chosen\nbased on personal history of\nexperiencing its characteristic\nsymptoms, and a strong desire to\nunderstand the nature of the disorder and its cultural/evolutionary significance.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nInitial intent was to gather\nacademic support for an intuitive\nsense of skepticism regarding the\nstatus of the psychological\nphenomenon being considered a\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdisorder\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the first place, preferring instead to consider the symptoms to be a consequence of our inability as a species to adapt to such a rapidly changing world. The unprecedented rate of technological development has\npresented us with a host of\nbewildering distractions that no\nsociety could ever be expected to\nimplement without accepting serious challenges due to our thoroughly specialized biological processing schemas. We have\ncreated a culture of over-stimulation, and our natural response to it has generally been to become numb, scattered, and short-sighted. Attention deficit? Preposterous! With all this insanity we have to deal with, being constantly bombarded with\ncompeting stimuli from every\ndirection, our attention has become\nour most limited resource. It's no\ndisorder. It's the human condition.\n\nConclusion:\n\nActually... no. Not so fast\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The\ncontents to follow will, if nothing else, demonstrate that it's not so simple.\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder and the Development of\nExecutive Function\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat kid just doesn't ever pay\nattention. I wonder what is wrong\nwith him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d . . . \u00e2\u0080\u009cHoney, better make\nan appointment to see his doctor, it\nmust be some kind of chemical\nimbalance\u00e2\u0080\u009d . . . \u00e2\u0080\u009cShouldn't he be\nconcerned about his grades? His\nchores? Respecting his elders, his\nteachers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d . . .\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re living in a culture of\ndiagnoses. An individual's unique\nqualities are perceived as\nshortcomings rather than recognized for what they could very well be - aspects of creative potential. In this investigation, I would like to propose that the very characteristics that cause one to be easily distracted, are the same traits that facilitate creative insight. So I have an idea - instead of\nmaking ourselves perplexed by asking why, when we attempt to shove things down a child's throat we are not always received with rainbows of pleasure and gratitude - I suggest we ask a very different question: What does it mean to pay\nattention?\n\nI do not mean paying attention as in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down and shut up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nAttention. The heart of this entire present inquiry rests upon the\nstunning realization of its full\nimplication. The things we choose to pay attention to - we choose for a very special reason. A reason that cuts to the core of our personality. A reason that we are defined by, shaped by our true sense of identity. The things that we give our attention - we give them the essence of our vitality. We allow\nthem to enter our being\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to penetrate us\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and become us. Attention\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it is all that we are.\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders, Fifth\nEdition (DSM-5), published by the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association,\ntakes a decidedly different approach to this particular set of symptoms that have been collectively labeled a disorder. Specifically, it is categorized as:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA neurodevelopmental disorder, which impairs the growthand development of the brain or central nervous system\u00e2\u0080\u009d. 1 This potentially affects the development of emotion, learning, self control, and memory throughout a person's early childhood through adulthood. Some examples of other\nneurodevelopmental disorders are\nintellectual disability (previously/less politely known as mental retardation), autism and autism spectrum disorders (e.g. Aspergers), Down syndrome, and\nschizophrenia. 1\n\nA combination of genetic and\nenvironmental contributing factors\nmay be present including prenatal or infantile exposure to tobacco, alcohol, drugs or environmental toxins, premature birth, low birth weight, and of course, genetics - according to twin studies, about 75% of cases come from cognitive traits inherited from one of the parents. 2\n\nWhat are these cognitive traits? A 2005 meta-analysis confirmed that\nADHD positively correlates with\nimpaired executive function - most\nstrongly and consistently with the\nfaculties of response inhibition,\nworking memory, vigilance, and\nplanning. 3\n\nThe first two - response\ninhibition (or inhibitory control) and\nworking memory, are among the first mental systems to appear in an infant's developing brain, typically between 7 to 12 months. Then from age 3 to 5 they undergo a spurt of rapid development, along with the first stages of cognitive flexibility, goal-directed behavior, and capability of planning. During pre-adolescence there is a marked increase in verbal working memory, goal-directed behavior, response inhibition, selective attention, strategic planning and organizational skills. 4\n\nAny attempt to link ADHD to a\nspecific physiological site is obviously futile, with all these cognitive functions developing independently at their own rate, and are progressively integrated together to form the complex network of brain systems\nresponsible for our ability to\nconcentrate.\n\nWhen the development of some\ncombination of these systems is\ncompromised in an individual, effects manifest that characterize ADHD. They primarily include inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. In addition, resulting secondary effects may also have an impact on friends, family and colleagues due to disruptive behavior, academic issues, and relationship problems. Primarily\ninattentive patients may be easily\ndistracted, forget details, or switch\nexcessively between tasks - unable to complete an activity without quickly getting bored. They may lose things, fail to listen, daydream, get confused, be physically or mentally sluggish or unable to follow directions. Those suffering from hyperactive/impulsive symptoms may experience fidgeting, squirming, restlessness, impatience, make inappropriate comments, uncontrolled emotion, and frequent interruptions. 5\n\nTo understand how these effects\nmanifest from poorly developed\nexecutive function, it is vital that we\nexplore the nature of concentration in all of its intricacy. In order to\nselectively focus on a particular\nstimulus, other information from the senses must be filtered out and\nignored. Working memory is of\nlimited capacity, and allocating it\naccordingly is part of our executive\nfunction, the supervising attentional system.\n\nOur dominant learned behavioral response to a stimulus, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cprepotent response\u00e2\u0080\u009d, was developed primarily to serve only our immediate survival needs. It must be overridden in order to achieve a more adaptive, delayed goal. We have just barely begun to learn, and the crucial skill that must be learned next is how to identify the signal from the noise to be filtered out. Paying attention is hard work - we are engaged in a battle with our own nature, by its very definition.\n\nAccording to the executive function\ntheory that the study supports, this\nfiltering process called inhibitory\nresponse is the first solid mental\nprocess connected to concentration. 6 Working memory is the second cognitive development confirmed in the meta-analysis. It is a short-term,\nlimited-capacity cognitive buffer that stores information and permits its manipulation to guide decision\nmaking and behavior. This is the place where the active, conscious agent of our awareness lives - the \"I\" with which we identify- it is here that the impressions of our experience that constitute our sense of self is accessed and processed. The prefrontal cortex\nexerts \u00e2\u0080\u009ctop-down\u00e2\u0080\u009d cognitive control, receiving its input from other cortical regions such as the association cortex, thalamus, and subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation such as the amygdala and central striatum, or nucleus accumbens. 6\n\nThe negative effects of ADHD present conditions in which prepotent responses dominate behavior. ADHD as we are conceptualizing it here is a disorder of executive faculty, a reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. It is a\ndiminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).\n\nThe third aspect of executive function is planning (forethought) -\nthinking about and organizing the\nactivities required to achieve a desired goal. An anticipatory decision-making process to deal with the complexities of evaluating each set of interrelated decisions. It is a selection of missions and objectives for translating knowledge into action. 6\n\nFinally, vigilance is sustained\nconcentration, the ability to maintain focus over prolonged periods of time. The deterioration in the ability to remain vigilant for critical signals with time, as indicated by a decline in the rate of the correct detection of signals is known as the vigilance decrement. This decrease in attention becomes significant within the first 15 minutes under most conditions, and even faster if there exists a high cognitive demand. 7\n\nAccording to signal detection theory, we are engaged in a decision making process in which we continually vary our sensitivity to sensory input to allow more or less correct detections at the respective cost of false alarms. This is known as criterion shift. The strategy creates a bias, based on how many false alarms we are willing to tolerate to achieve a higher rate of detection, thereby\nminimizing the consequences of either missed targets or false positives.\n\nVigilance is dependant on the state of arousal, taking place in the amygdala, which plays an important role in the recognition of emotional stimuli. 8\n\nResearch conducted in the 1940s\ndemonstrated that psychostimulant medications, when given to participants, caused a highly significant reduction of the\nvigilance decrement. This is the targeted effect of modern pharmaceutical treatment for ADHD. 9\n\nMedications however, only address the symptoms in the short-term. The best methods for long-term\nmanagement of ADHD involve\nencouraging healthy learning skills\nthough behavioral therapy. Aerobic\nexercise is proven to have a positive strengthening effect on the cognitive processes needing development. 10\n\nThe results of our research have\nbeen enlightening. Our original\nhypothesis, that ADHD is not actually a disorder, may be trivially plausible, as there is a long history of controversy regarding the diagnosis. There are certainly cases where it is misidentified due to other factors. However, quite early on in the course of study this stance was showing to be off-base, due to the very specified diagnostic criteria. After all, it is not by low intelligence or an act of rebellion that these actions occur. The\nindividual presenting actual ADHD\npossesses both the desire and the\nintellect to perform tasks, but is\nspecifically and excessively lacking in the areas of executive function,\ncompared to individuals of similar\nage.\n\nClinical psychology is often perceived as arbitrarily judgemental. But when properly understood through the scope of its own definitional landscape, this misconception is quickly put to rest.\n\nReferences\n\n1. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAttention Deficit\n\nHyperactivity Disorder\".\n\nNational Institute of Mental\n\nHealth.

It can be predominantly autobiographical content, but what is the book going to offer to someone who doesn't know or care about me whatsoever?\n\nSo I decided to make the book about the psycho-sociological effect of modern technology like smartphones and social networking.

        "post": "So what's the story, you ask, the inspiration behind my new business venture, the Internet of Non-Things? It may sound funny but it is not just a joke. It is actually very serious and meaningful... Allow me to explain:\n\nThe inspiration began during the Summer of 2016. I didn't have any Things, not even a cellphone. I had one but it got stolen.\n\nSometimes Things get stolen.\n\nI lived a life without Things. Every day I would go to the library to use their Things to do my research, writing, and communication. Finally I took out a student loan and got a $20 Android phone. It was great... I had acquired a Thing.\n\nI started teaching, and thought that a Thing with a bigger screen would be really nice for my classes. So I bought a cheap 10\" tablet. It was great... I now had another Thing.\n\nA few days later, I broke my Thing. I don't know how it happened, but there was a huge crack in the touchscreen and it wouldn't respond at all, you couldn't even get past the lock screen on my Thing.\n\nSometimes Things break.\n\nSo I spent a little more money and got a Windows Thing. That broke too. Eventually I would take it back to Walmart and get a new Windows Thing, but in the mean time I decided to finally break down and get an Apple Thing. After having a couple cheap tablets break on me, I figured a real iPad would help me actually get my work done. They control every aspect of their Things, so I thought I might have a dependable Thing for once.\n\nThe reliability of that Thing turned out to come with a heavy cost - tons of things I'm used to doing with my Things either weren't possible, or whatever hoops needing to be jumped through were beyond my level of patience to discover. Ugh... I had this really nice Thing that was crippled with crazy limitations. I just want to save a file. Wait... how do you save a file? \n\nI'd had quite enough of this wrestling with my Things. I was sick of it. I decided that the only solution was to do what normal students do, and buy a real laptop Thing. So I got a really nice Lenovo Thing.\n\nWow! Everything just worked! At last, I could just get things done on my Thing! It was amazing! It was surreal! It was.... too good for me. I thought for what I do I didn't really need such an expensive Thing. I figured that if I returned my expensive Thing, the money would go further buying other Things. I got a Raspberry Pi Thing, a tiny $35 Linux Thing. And I got an e-reader Thing, an easier on the eyes extended battery life Thing.\n\nWow! So very many Things! The great part of having several Things is then I could run apps for Android Things, iOS Things, Windows Things, and Linux Things! When the limitations of one Thing would bog me down, chances are it might work on another Thing. It turned out to facilitate a smoother workflow as well having multiple screens on different Things, instead of having to constantly switch tasks on one Thing.\n\nThe problem with having so many Things is carrying them around. I'd schlep my Things to a library or coffee shop, and it would take me 15 minutes to set up all my Things. Then what if I need to use the bathroom? One day I left my Things set up for a brief moment, only to return to catch campus police throwing all my Things into a trash bag. They were \"keeping it safe\", they said.\n\nConstant harassments like these with campus police eventually led to me to have to quit school and leave Austin.\n\nThe cumbersome nature of too many things became extremely apparent when I hit the road. I found myself crippled by my Things. In Albuquerque I found myself a shopping cart with which to push around my Things, most treasured of all was my beautiful harmonium that I hand painted. I painted and bedazzled all my Things.\n\nYes...I was that guy pushing a shopping cart around town. But never had a bum cart been filled with such nice Things. Then one night.... One awful, terribly painful night...\n\nWhile at McDonald's in Albuquerque, my beloved harmonium disappeared. Someone had obviously stolen it. \n\nOuch. At first my incredible loss did not even register. It actually took a couple days for the devastation to set in. That instrument had come to define me. It was not only my livelihood, my source of income, it was how I expressed myself. Without an instrument...I was lost. I no longer had my most precious Thing.\n\nFrom that point onward, I would turn my creative energy to my other Things. My electronic Things. I would adapt my ability to make music to not require an acoustic Thing. At the same time I was getting heavily involved with coding, learning to program my Things. I discovered that writing programs can be just as powerful of an outlet for creativity as music, if not more so! Coding is problem solving - which I have found to represent the highest level of human ingenuity. Once I began to understand this, I was hooked. I was having so much fun nerding out with my Things, I rarely missed my old Thing - which I could only blame myself for losing - it was too much for me. Too many Things.\n\nOur travels took us from New Mexico to Arizona to Cali. San Francisco turned out to be another tragedy for our Things...\n\nThey robbed us while we were sleeping. They stole nearly all our Things. The bass guitar Thing, 3 computing Things...\n\nAll we are left with now is the little Android Thing, and my iPad Thing. A very very sad day for Things. But once the initial anger subsided... I ironically found myself extremely relieved. All of a sudden I could walk around freely, unencumbered by so many Things!\n\nAnd as far as my productivity... I'm actually enjoying the challenge of just working with one Thing (even though it ended up being the Apple Thing...). In reality, humans are terrible multitaskers. It seems that possibly having multiple Things encourages switching tasks haphazardly... With only one Thing, it forces you to stick to one task longer since you can't so quickly glance over to another Thing. It manages your attention differently, and often quite positively.\n\nAnd here is where it gets interesting... and responsible for inspiring...\n\nThe Internet of Non-Things.\n\nI'm finding that the sudden forced shift in my workflow precipitated by this radical reduction in my arsenal of Things has modified the trajectory of my programming. With only an iPad Thing, I can only really code from within a text editor or web browser. I can no longer use a Python interpreter or a Java compiler - those only ran on my other Things.\n\nI must now develop in the cloud exclusively. I must turn my focus to JavaScript, which will run on any Thing that has a web browser. I had not appreciated this before when I had all my Things. \n\nI have learned that we are in many ways slaves to our Things. This experience convinces me that overall happiness tends to have an inverse relationship to our level of ownership of Things. Now I know what I must do - to push our community towards independence from Things. \n\nWelcome to the Internet of Non-Things."

They prescribed me blood pressure medication.\n\nI was gonna walk 40 miles to Silicon Valley, about 16 hours. But I got to Oakland (most ghetto-ass place ever) and my feet started to hurt, so I went to the train station and told the girl I needed to get my blood pressure medication for my vascular condition.\n\nIt didn't work. \"If you want to go there you need money\", she said. So what does a wingnut do in this situation? Listen carefully....\n\nYou sit down. Just sit down right there.\n\nI fished out my prescription and discharge paperwork, and checked the time.

Python rocks... It's the best \"beginner\" language to come out since Basic, and for the past few weeks I've been totally immersed in it. \n\nI want to talk to anyone on here who is interested in programming, and would encourage others to get into it. We're all on computers after all... We ought to learn to use them!"

Why *would* anyone want to read my book?\n\nThen when I thought about it more, I realized what the *real* question should have been: \n\nWhat is so fucking interesting about *anything* that makes it worth reading?\n\nReading is kind of a chore, and today there are more words shoved in our faces than ever battling for our precious deficient attention. In fact most people have already stopped reading this post, if they even started at all.\n\nI find that a lot of the time it's not so much what is being said but *how* it is said, presenting the material in a novel, accessible, inspiring form. My favorite authors and speakers could talk about fucking sports and keep my interest. I've listened to Penn Jillette talk for countless hours about his diet that helped him lose 100 pounds, and it nearly makes me want to start eating nothing but whole plants with no salt sugar or oil, and wash it down with a blueberry cacao cayenne smoothie. And I barely weigh 140 pounds.\n\nAnd I hate blueberries."

I don't know how these things work in internet land but whoever is listening to and sharing it, thank you! It actually made me like.... almost 5 dollars! This song has a very special history:\n\nIt came from a song I wrote with my dad in like 1998. I played bass and he played guitar. We set up a fostex 4-track and jammed it out, then I programmed the drums, wrote the lyrics and sang it. This was to present a demo to pitch the song to the band, but when the singers heard it they said that I should just sing it myself! So this track marks the time that I emerged as an actual vocalist.\n\nA dubstep track typically follows the form of 32 bars building up to the drop. But this one just has a 2 bar windup and smacks you right in the face. The combination of modern electronic sounds and melodic vocals and more traditional songwriting is what I imagine has caused this track to be the most popular on the album.\n\nI love the line, \"Before you go, stop and take a look around\". That's why I decided to end the song with it repeating on the fadeout. It reminds us to be more present during pivotal moments in our lives. No matter what choices we make, we should always have a time where we reflect, breathe, and take a look around at the situation you are leaving. Then whatever the outcome, at least you will know that you took that moment before making a crucial decision. And who knows... It may just cause you to make a better one."

I currently have around 150 pages of material, and through this process I've noticed something very interesting:\n\n2013 was a major creative explosion for me. It was the year that I finally recorded and released my debut album which represented over 15 years of musical composition - my life's work. I also posted more on Facebook than ever: over 11,000 words. After that, I went back to my usual 2-3000.\n\nUntil this year. My word count for 2016 is pushing 15,000 and there's still 2 months left!\n\nThat's such a huge difference that demands an explanation! The only thing I can think of is that those are the years during which I moved to a new place and started school. However in 2011 I went to Israel to study, undoubtedly the biggest move of my life, and wrote relatively little. On Facebook, at least. I do recall an enormous amount of private email activity at the time. So yes definitely... Traveling and school are both possible factors.\n\nI encourage anyone who takes social media seriously to go to your Facebook settings and download your data. You get files containing the entirety of your profile activity. Yes, everything! If you publicly share your Pandora, Spotify, etc., then you get to wade through EVERY SONG you've listened to, so it's a bit overwhelming. But it's worth it. To help understand yourself. What personal revelations will you discover?"

If you twist my cyberontological arm, I'll post a link for any and all to read.\n\nThis week we began the study of Descartes and had a class debate over whether interaction with other individuals is necessary to know that we exist. Since I was practically going into seizures in my chair I had to be the asshole who asks \"what does it mean to exist\"?\n\nThat got the class's attention. I continued: \"If I imagine a triangle, does it exist? By some definition, yes! It has a physical existence as a pattern of neurons in my brain!\"\n\nWhat would these poor students do without me?

        "post": "It's quite unlike me to leave you all hanging for such a long time, and it pains me greatly to consider the anxiety I have undoubtedly caused by my failure to keep you constantly updated as usual. The past few weeks have been so uniquely stimulating that scarcely did a brief moment occur that I found myself thinking of Facebook. I apologize deeply as it was not my intention to ignore you, however I have some heartbreaking news for those of you awaiting my return for which I've been struggling to find the proper words: I have decided I am quitting school and will not be returning home as planned.\n\nWhen I read the article I thought it must be a joke, for it seemed too fantastical, too perfect to be a real place. The website seemed legit though, so I proceeded to make some phone calls before embarking on the trip. I figured it wouldn't set me back excessively to spend a day there to check it out. Little did I know that they were looking for a full-time music teacher, and when I told them my story they decided to give me an interview on the spot. They said that although I lack credentials, the formal education typically required to teach music, my extensive experience with people of all walks of life and unique approach more than make up for it, and that I would be a great addition to their organization.\n\nThey call it the Ukuleground, but it's not just for kids. It's not just about ukuleles either. They offer lessons in guitar, piano, violin and voice, but their program happens to involve itself the most with the instrument that has established itself as a conveniently practical, surprisingly versatile, universally accessible icon of modern music: The ukulele. It is used for a multitude of styles, everything from classical to punk rock. It requires very little hand strength and the chords are less complicated than guitar. It sits particularly well with the vocal range and is so small and lightweight you can practically wear it. I was originally inspired to pick up the ukulele by performers such as Tiny Tim and Amanda Palmer, and I found it so addictive, so intimately expressive that I felt like everyone should have one. It has such a pure musical simplicity that makes it the perfect personal accessory to carry around. Now that I am part of the Ukuleground, I can do my part to get them into the hands of more people.\n\nThe service that we provide here is a charity for the community. It has full nonprofit status and falls under the category of music and art therapy, funded partly by donations but primarily by selling the instruments that are manufactured and uniquely decorated in-house by the clients and staff. One of the rooms is a workshop where you can learn how to build your very own ukulele, and then we have the finishing room where they are brought to life as unique art pieces with all kinds of oils, paints and stains. Some people choose to then add  sparkles, glitter and rhinestones, and spray on a coat of varnish for a bedazzled uke. I wish you could see the joy on their faces when these folks discover that they can create a real instrument with their own hands.\n\nThe Ukuleground was inspired by the work of Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin, author of \"This Is Your Brain On Music\". In his book, he challenges the notion that music is merely \"auditory cheesecake\", an evolutionary byproduct of human communication faculties, and presents his case that it has continually served an essential role in our psychosocial development throughout our history as a species. It is an entirely recent phenomenon, he says, that some people do not consider themselves musicians. Perpetuated by the myth that talent is something that you either have or you don't, music has been taken out of the hands of the common people and become the domain of an elite few. Curiously however, music is the only skill for which we have come to demand such a high level of proficiency in order to enjoy doing. Levitin uses sports and cooking as counterexamples. You don't have to be as skilled as Michael Jordan to play a game of basketball out back, or as skilled as Rachel Ray in the kitchen to make a nice dinner. We have come to treat music differently, creating the perception that unless you can achieve a certain level of technical mastery, you aren't good enough to take part in the activity. Its wonderful power as a medium for creative personal expression and communal bonding has begun to fade from our culture. It is this unfortunate situation that our facility aims to reverse, and provides the cornerstone of our philosophy: To empower individuals to explore their creative potential. At the Ukuleground, we believe that music is not merely something that we do. It is what we are. Music for the people, by the people and of the people.\n\nBesides empowering people by enabling them to create their very own instruments with which to make music, the Ukuleground is also empowering some to become teachers, such as myself. I never thought I could have such a positive effect on so many people. So although it is with deep sorrow that I will not be returning to Austin, I hope you at least now understand why I feel I have been called to do this. \n\nI love you all so much and you will be sorely missed. But perhaps one day, the stars will align and the city that is known as the \"live music capital of the world\" may achieve another level of greatness and create a similar music space of its own. I can only dream. Until then my beloved Facebook friends, I bid you farewell. I have some very special work to do."

I hate having to print stuff out every day contributing to the mountain of waste. It's inefficient, cumbersome, noisy, ecologically unsound, and frankly unhealthy. \n\n2. My college professors have effectively banned the use of phones, laptops and tablets in class (which I believe is absolutely absurd but that's for another post), but *this* I'd get away with!\n\nYes the price rather outrageous, but for the gain in convenience, I would spend twice that.

        "post": "My Psychology of Personality textbook uses Kurt Cobain as a model for psychoanalysis. I'm not sure how I feel about that... \n\nI also question the authority of the biography used. According to Jack Endino (who knew him very well), Azerrad is the only one to be trusted.\n\nReliability issue aside, since I happen to be an Adlerian, here's a section I find particularly interesting:\n\nAccording to Adler's theory, the fundamental driving force in personality is the struggle to move from a \"felt minus\" to a \"felt plus\" situation. This coalesces to a fictional finalism,  a view of the goal of a person's striving. In Cobain's case, according to his biographer (Cross, 2001 ), Kurt explicitly and adamantly expressed this goal to a friend at age 14: \"I'm going to be a superstar musician, kill myself, and go out in a flame of glory\" (p. 34). That would achieve the goal of being noticed and arousing empathy and guilt in others. The paradox of the success and the self-destruction was captured in a crayon drawing that he made: \"a stick figure with a huge smiley face for a head, chopping off his left leg with an axe. The title reads: 'Mr. Sunshine Commits Suicide\"'(Cross, 2001 , p. 129).\n\nCobain's parents doted on him when he was a young child, according to  his  biographer (Cross, 2001 ), but at age 3 he was \"de\u00c2\u00adthroned,\" as Adler would express it, to  share their attention with his baby sister. He seemed to cope by becoming very close to his sister Kim\u00c2\u00adberly. Later, his parents   divorced and his mother, in her new marriage, turned her atten\u00c2\u00adtion to another child, depriving Kurt even further of parental attention. He was shuttled from one home to another, and sometimes was not wel\u00c2\u00adcome in either, crashing instead with other rela\u00c2\u00adtives, neighbors, or outdoors. Adler's theory emphasizes sibling rivalry as an important con\u00c2\u00adtributor to personality, and he considers the jeal\u00c2\u00adousy of the oldest child for younger rivals to be a significant trauma that can  lead to emotional disturbances, even when parents do not split up. Even at age 24, Cobain was distressed enough about his sister to include, almost at the begin\u00c2\u00adning of his autobiography, the reminiscence that in childhood, his sister had destroyed his new tin drum set. Cobain tried to earn his father's love by living up to the expected role for a male adolescent, playing sports, but it was not a good fit for him, thus contributing to his feelings of inferiority. Adler describes an inferiority com\u00c2\u00adplex as a neurotic outcome, and Cobain's con\u00c2\u00adtinued embarrassment at his own skinny body is evidence that he suffered such an inferiority complex.\n\nAdler would understand the background factors contributing to Cobain's troubled person\u00c2\u00adality. However, Adler held each person respon\u00c2\u00adsible for choosing his or her own style of life. Childhood neglect is a challenge, but  others with situations as difficult and even worse have been able to compensate for what was missing in their lives and move on to a socially useful style of life."

        "post": "This first week of Fall term started off in absolute characteristic fashion, knowing full well that any given set of my typical daily interactions will undoubtedly reveal the most extreme, insane, grotesque corners of human civilization.\n\nThis shit needs to be in a book:\n\nGoing to my first class. What could possibly go wrong, as I board the bus to ride 1.5hrs to this high school where my English Comp course is held?\n\nWell, the ticket machine is broken, the thing into which you put your money - so the driver informs me that since I can't pay my fare she cannot give me a ride!\n\nSo what do I do? (You're starting to catch on, I know it...) just a wild guess, hmmm?\n\nThat's right....\n\nFREAK OOOOOUUUUUT!  I have to get to class!\n\nSo she says she'll get the supervisor on the phone. Not only was I allowed to ride but I rode for free! But this isn't even the point of the story, it just happened to be another funny thing that occurred on the way. A practice catastrophe, a supplemental warm up for our ascent to Mt Fucked....\n\nLuckily I anticipated having no clue where I was going and allowed extra time, because this place was a maze!\n\nA funny feeling came about me as I entered the high security part of the school. I felt their eyeballs pretty much burning me as I walked into the office, proudly declaring that I'm lost. They tell me to sit down and I am promptly escorted by security into another room, the grown-up version of the principal's office. No joke... I tell them I'm here for class and give the instructor's name.\n\nThey then inform me that this class is only for students enrolled at that school.\n\nIn other words.... I went to my class, and they wouldn't let me in!\n\nI spent the whole rest of the day, and half the night, trying to figure out how to deal with this... it spiraled into a scheduling nightmare, as I was utterly incapable of finding classes that would work at this point. I decide I need to sleep on it, and see the counselor in the morning so they can help me figure out my schedule... it was completely messed up..... (which is actually) totally normal.\n\nHowever, I did end up figuring out a solution once my head cleared - I just needed the advisor to give approval that I be allowed to join another english class that is already in session, since it was completely not my fault! What, they make a class exclusive, but then fail to tell you, let you register and arrive only to kick you out!\n\nThe counselor agreed with me passionately, and was actually appalled that the sign up was so unclear that something like that could happen.\n\nWhat resulted from this whole thing is that at the last minute all my classes had to be switched around so they could be masterfully assembled into an impossible order that can only exist in the presence of a specific concentration of dark matter. So it was all reshuffled; new teachers, new classmates, new daily routine.\n\nAnd I'm quite pleased with the outcome. These be sum reeeeaal teeeeaacherrrs ....\n\nGotta say tho, there be a whole lotta  butthurt among the teachers over cellphones and computers and stuff.... oh boy, it just lights their buttholes on fire with kerosene and sandpaper and salt and a generous heaping of horseradish. \n\nSmeared all up in their butts."

Yes, anything at all.\n\nThe iPad is almost as ruthless. If I could just somehow peer inside his mind, but for a few minutes, I can say I'd have a chance of comprehending his ways. But he is always hiding from me and I don't know the proper way to approach him about this issue. I just hate to see him suffering in such pain.\n\nSometimes I feel like I ought to just ask David Murney; but alas, it would be too easy... he'd tell me exactly what to do, and I'd be left with perfectly running hardware and software, and nothing to do except drink 14 more pots of coffee and think about impending doom.\n\n#Windows10Tablet  #WaitWhyTheFuckWouldYouPutWindows10OnAnOversizedSmartphone #MostUselessPieceOfShitEver #MommyMyComputerWontLeaveMeAlone #ProbablyOughtToJailbreakSoon #WhyAmIMakingHashtags #IveNeverMadeHashtagsOnFacebookBefore #FuckThisShit"

I even tried a Windows 10 2-in-1 tablet PC...  turns out it's the only tablet for which there is absolutely NO WAY to input text other than the ridiculously terrible hunt-and-peck method... \n\nSo I finally took the plunge last week  and got the cheapest actually decent apple... the ipad mini 2...\n\n...and I already want to throw the thing out the window,  blow it up with firecrackers....\n\nIn many ways it's actually WORSE than the Windows tablet,  which was so bad it couldn't play videos at all, or even SONGS without constantly stuttering! All it was really useful for was typing on... without a method of text entry that works for me!\n\nBut... at least I could OPEN A FILE WITH A PROGRAM!\n\nMaybe it just takes some time to learn ways around the walls that Apple puts around the most basic functions, making it so you can't do anything... as if your computer is not even really yours. I understand why it's called \"jailbreak\" (the ios version of rooting), which i should probablu do, but they just this week released a security update msking it harder, and id probabl end up brickibg the thing anyway...  if i dobt rnf up breaking it actially on purpose first... aplle people.... please help me out here.... how do you deal with these things? Do you just use other platforms to get around it?\n\nComputers supposedly exist to servr us and make us more productivr . But it seems like I've become a slave to them, days go by just trying to troubleshoot a single issue, and all of a sudden I've become a full-time computer tech who gets no pay and no actual work done.\n\nNote: I am not fixing typos today, because this is MATH DAY"

First of all, no more courses that cram it all into 5 weeks! It moves way too fast, and I didn't know any better. Then, he talked me out of taking government and history at all next term.

        "post": "I feel like I've learned more at school this summer than ever before in my entire life. But not from the classes. Not from the teachers, or about the subjects at all.  \n\nI've been learning about myself. Learning about students, about teachers, learning about life... about work, about school... learning about learning. And about teaching. \n\nWhat makes a good teacher? A bad teacher? I want to say that there aren't any truly good or bad teachers, that it's really just a matter of preference; it's a question of chemistry. Which really means... communication. \n\nEvery teacher is qualified and completely knowledgeable by default, or they wouldn't be there. But what separates a good teacher from a bad one is how they are able to communicate their knowledge. \n\nI had a nervous breakdown last week because of these 2 classes that I really didn't want to be taking in the first place. One was a course in US government, with one of the most awesome teachers I've ever had. The other was in American history, with possibly one of the worst teachers I've ever had.\n\nNotice I used the word \"was\" when referring to the classes that were basically ruining my life, because I dropped them both.\n\nProblem solved! \n\nMoral of the story: If something is giving you trouble in life... get rid of it and move on.\n\n(Disclaimer: actual results may vary)\n\nAnyway... the point of this post was supposed to, well, have a point. I was going to go into some deeply poetic, pseudo-intellectual diatribe about what makes a good or bad teacher. Because that's what I've had to figure out... since I just stated that I had in these 2 courses juxtaposed simultaneously one of the best and worst teachers, what is the criteria that I'm using for that judgment? \n\nWell... since I'm just rambling anyway, I'll start this thing with the greatest example of the BAD teacher. \n\nThis is the way you should NOT teach your class:\n\n[Teacher giving lecture... booooorrrriinnnggg]\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n[Student politely interrupts to ask question, completely\nrelevant to the topic, honest request for clarification.]\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n[Teacher has trouble answering the question, gets confused and frustrated, and proceeds to make the student feel ashamed for getting the lesson so far off track].\n\nThis is not the way to communicate knowledge. If all you are doing is giving a lecture by following a script, why are we even here? We might as well be watching a YouTube video, listening to a podcast, or reading a book.\n\nYou are not a teacher, you are a robot. \n\nGoodbye.\n\nAssociate Professor Casagranda, that wasn't you I was referring to. You're not that guy... you're the good teacher, we're cool!\n\nYou know why you're such an awesome teacher? Because you were always pausing to check in with us and ask,\n\n\"Are we cool\"? . . . \"Is that cool\"?\n\nEven though every time I really felt like screaming back, \n\n\"Yes WE'RE cool! But no IT'S not cool! Because you're the cool teacher, but I'm gonna have to drop your class too, because you're just gonna end up an unfortunate casualty of my nervous breakdown, which was completely caused by the awful teacher, the other guy who is not cool.\"\n\nSo not cool....\n\nEDIT:\nJust need to conclude...\n\nDon't be that guy. If you're a teacher....\n\nBE A TEACHER!!!! NOT A ROBOT!\n\nWe could be anywhere in the world, with anyone at all... but we're here to learn from you. Please don't ever forget that!\n\nBe like Associate Professor Casagranda. He is such a good teacher that I would often completely forget that I was even in class. \n\nThe best teacher... is one who engages the students so deeply that they might not even realize that they are actually learning.\n\nBut we are indeed. \n\nBe like that guy."

        "post": "Learning about memory for psych class, and my brain just exploded... it seems that discovering the way memory works can do more to explain our nature than anything else.\n\nOur memories make up who we are... our very perception of the world and how we relate to it only begins to make sense in our consciousness when it is compared and contrasted with our previous experience.\n\nTo explain more fully, sensory data comes into the brain, containing extremely detailed information describing the world around us. Way more information than we can process right now using all our equipment! \n\nSo, what happens to all the rest of the information? \n\nIt gets thrown away, because we don't know what it means, and can't use it. Unrecognized file format, no plug-in found...Because it has no reference in the long-term memory, it lacks the necessary software to decode it. This top-down signal from the long term memory actually accounts for half of our perception, our experience of the world around us.\n\nThat means that all the information coming from the senses that cannot be made sense of in light of our current understanding, never becomes encoded into our short term memory, it is immediately forgotten and we are never even aware that it was perceived at all.\n\nSo... is there any possible way to break out of this seemingly hopeless lack of awareness? What if we could somehow construct an alternate form of consciousness that would utilize the sensory input data without requiring a model in the long term memory? Or, create some kind of experiential \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaster key\u00e2\u0080\u009d with which to provide a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvirtual memory\u00e2\u0080\u009d loosely made to functionally correspond to the incoming data?\n\nThese are just a couple of highly speculative possibilities I am exploring right now. Let me ask a question- how do we explain our first experiences and memories? Is there some kind of pre-installed software consisting of a memory \u00e2\u0080\u009cstarter pack\u00e2\u0080\u009d upon which to build our consciousness? Or, is there some mechanism with which to \u00e2\u0080\u009crip\u00e2\u0080\u009d incoming data on the fly, directly to the hard drive?\n\nMy suspicion is that it could cause overwhelming contradictions in our process of discerning reality from background noise or imagination, similar to the way an individual suffering from schizophrenia is interpreting signals as real that don't exist in reality. Could there be somewhere in our mental toolbox a \u00e2\u0080\u009cthreshold\u00e2\u0080\u009d control, that could fine-tune which input is interpreted as real vs imaginary?\n\nI tend to wonder if this could be the process that is mediated by and initiated through the activation of the 5-HT2a receptor in the human nervous system, which provides the mechanism for the psychedelic experience.\n\nIt was this very inquiry, attempting to discover how LSD works, that caused the cutting edge of brain science to advance into the identification of various serotonin receptors, all responsible for different forces of physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual development. All psychedelic substances, whether ergoline (LSD \u00e2\u0080\u009cacid\u00e2\u0080\u009d), tryptamine (mushrooms, DMT) or phenethylamine (mescaline, from cacti), act upon the 5-ht2a receptor to produce hallucinations and the various other changes to our awareness.\n\nSo what is the point of the trip? In other words, what use does this part of the brain serve to support healthy development, and what exactly is being developed?\n\nIt's removing/adjusting the filter, allowing sensory input to enter our consciousness, the stuff that we never had access to because we cannot understand it... all simply because we have never experienced it before. This creates the opportunity to redefine our perception of life and our understanding of our place in the universe, which retroactively defines our very sense of self, bringing us to a deeper, expanded concept of who we are. Through this we can break down the barriers between the senses and our perception to allow further development of this mental circuitry and gain access to a more complete representation of reality.\n\nI've heard much of this stuff before from people who have experience with psychedelics, but now it actually makes sense! \n\n(Because it makes more SENSE...GET IT?)\n\nDisclaimer: no illegal activity is admitted or encouraged. While the process of enlightenment facilitated by these receptors is part of our innate biology, consuming substances to artificially activate them is not. Perhaps they can be activated through our own conscious will and experience... But this, my enlightened friends, is an entirely different post...\n\nHappy experiencing! Believe in and achieve your dreams! Don't let the parasitic memories bite!"

Hanson + Korn = not even funny. \n\nSo the song suffered from debilitating depression due to extreme identity crisis, finding relief only through self-harm, when it decided to switch into a minor key (since it was pretty much the only song of mine that was not), and oh....\n\nWow. Minor key me likey SO moar bettR. Suddenly the melody is speaking from its soul!\n\nI made this with Ableton Live for Electronic Music class a couple years ago, and it's still one of my favorites because it's so dark, grindy and tedious sounding, like bang-your-head-with-a-hammer  Adagio in A minor.\n\nThe class was speechless and a bit frightened, which means my goal was achieved. Finally the instructor broke the silence by saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell... sorry, just kinda blown away. This is the music we'll be listening to a thousand years from now.

The topic is endlessly fascinating to me in the most relevant way I can imagine. Brain science. Neurotransmitters. Consciousness. It's what we are. It's the most logical starting point when I ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat's going on here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d! Descartes said \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a thinking thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but what is doing the thinking? Something like 86 billion neurons....\n\nIn modern Hebrew a computer is called a \u00e2\u0080\u009cma\u00e1\u00b8\u00a5she\u00e1\u00b8\u0087\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cthinking thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It's my favorite word that was coined in Israel. Central Processing Unit. The first computers, though, were in fact people. The digital silicon-based ones are vastly more efficient at accurately storing and recalling information, but the meaty brain is way way WAY more specialer...more unique...  Unfathomably powerful, but in its own weird, quirky way... weaving our perception into a story in real time, producing self-awareness.\n\nNow the internet... that's totally a giant brain, that we are all constantly building together. It's dynamic, flexible, diverse, made of specialized parts that communicate with each other in myriad ways... Presenting to the subjective user a phenomenology that is constantly fluttering somewhere between painfully boring and utterly terrifying, churning up copious quantities of the unimaginable while often coming up curiously vacant of whatever you happen to be obsessively seeking.\n\nThe day will likely come when our brains of flesh will have thought our last. That's when I hope to move into the cloud... and just live in the internet! Maybe that's what heaven will be. I can compose electronic music and blog for the rest of eternity, putting cartoons on YouTube and teaching classes to pay for my software and bandwidth.\n\nSpeaking of which, tonight at 6pm I'll be having a study group at 2202 Nueces. It's free, all are welcome! If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re outside of Austin maybe you could join us on video chat... otherwise, why not stop on down and sing and color with us, while we still together can meet as meat."

Hardly any people have seen this animation, I only know about it because I lived with the guy who created it, in Safed, Israel where we were studying and playing music together. He has such a deep passion for cartoons - he talked about his background in animation school during our mystical philosophy lesson, comparing the concept of shading to the way God's light shines in the world, and I was blown away by how much sense he made while comparing deep Hasidic theological concepts to art! Then when he showed me this, I was blown away again by how much personality he managed to put into the letters, which is exactly how we need to learn them, by bringing them to life and making them real to us. He got the Rabbi's kids to do the voices!\n\nI just now had a great idea that we can do together - We can go through the words in this story to learn the letters (and some great words that include them), and then we'll make our own version with words from the Gospel! It will serve as a model for learning Hebrew in a Christian context, and maybe we could even make our own video eventually!?!"

It's pretty much the same everywhere. The dream of finding somewhere totally \"exotic\" was not fulfilled, but was rather misguided - you have to LOVE the cheesy pop songs, they are annoyingly infectious because they are well made, kinda like fast food and other mind-altering substances, pornography, and anything designed to mimic authentic stimulation. However, if you carry the logic out further, you'll find that nearly everything is an artificial form of something that works by exploiting our brain-goodies. Music itself, some say, is merely auditory cheesecake. And cheesecake is really really good!"

As I've been talking to and getting to know you, lots of you have mentioned that you are interested in learning Hebrew, or that you have been trying to but aren't getting very far very fast. I want to fix that by starting a weekly study session where we will make it super fun and inspiring using the traditions that I was a part of in New York, Oregon and Israel over the past 10 years. We can also go through RVL's material as part of the course, and it will include deep examination of the prophecies that were fulfilled through Jesus, such as the songs of the Suffering Servant in the book of Isaiah. And singing too! Let's see who may be interested by discussing it here or in person, or both, and we'll figure out more details! God bless!"

The song absolutely nails the whole concept of a love tragedy, so I decided to use it as the central motif in my opera, which I've been planning to write ever since 2006 when @[1047678684:2048:Kylie Kahnke] helped me come up with the idea.\n\nI realized that MOST of the lyrics to my songs describe love tragedies! So I will simply weave them all together and voila! I have already composed the entire soundtrack! The main theme will be \"hard-hearted Barbary Allen\", who realizes her mistake only once it is too late. The different verses will play as a recurring motif throughout the drama, moving the story forward.\n\nThis melody is the lesser- known one for the poem. I pretty much hate the popular one which Johnny Cash uses and so many others. Search for it on YouTube if you want to vomit with me. I suppose it's not actually terrible... but compared to the supreme epicness of this one it sends me into immediate \"no, no, NO shut it off shut it off shut it off\" mode! In the comments below, I will post a link to a live musical performance of this melody that I recently found.\n\nTo make this track, I started with the audio of the lovely Jean Ritchie singing the tune a-cappella. Without ever hearing it in a harmonic or rhythmic setting, I had to speed it up and time-stretch it to a dance beat and figure out how I wanted to interpret the chord progression. But the moment that I struck remix gold was when I added the musical fill in order to bring it to an even number of measures (You know... that little flute dittie that echos the vocal)!\n\nIn addition to transforming this song into a drama, there will also be a new dance track produced in the future. It will have fewer verses, more developed musical breaks and vocal harmonies, and more drum programming.\n\nOne last interesting note about this tune:\n\nIt is the only time I EVER used the \"Modern Talking\" patch in Massive. That's the one everybody used to do the super- annoying cheesy Dubstep noises, but I used it in a really subtle way.\n@[509855932427215:274:Bombastic Dubstep]\nhttps://youtu.be/yQzVAFyQbYk"

I came here to meet the crew of The Atheist Experience and volunteer in the control room, and they have been more welcoming and supportive than I could have expected. \n\nThen there is the local street scene, which is vital for my lifestyle. Money is very difficult to make, but a solid sub-network of friendly co-dwellers makes the struggle worthwhile.\n\nBut what completely surprised me... are the Christians! Just for fun, I began a weekly Bible study at the university. And... I'm almost flabbergasted by how much these guys have embraced me. Having previously been a total believer, then shattered by doubt, I now realize that since religion is never going to go away, and that theists are definitely not stupid, that the best path for me is to play along with them, and this can absolutely be done without being in any way disingenuous. Call it a kind of revelation I've had. You can actually have faith while accepting all the doubts, and this overcomes the danger that is caused by cognitive dissonance. I've been going to their gatherings, making friends with them and conducting study sessions, giving me the opportunity to teach again since these guys are endlessly fascinated by the Jewish tradition. \n\nWhen I stopped being religious I wanted nothing more than to move on to \"relevant\" areas of study and get over all the time I had invested into something that I could no longer accept as real. But my interest in religion never actually went away, no matter how fed up and embarrassed by it I had become. My discovery of atheism filled the void, but is in reality an integral part of the religious continuum.\n\nNow it is time to put it all together and build bridges, and continue to learn and inspire people like we always have. After all... what would Jesus do?"

I didn't change a single note of the composition, I just arranged it for bass and lead synths, put it to a drum beat and added the Yosemite Sam samples.\n\nPaganini was cool. He was the original musician of the Faustian legend in which he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for superhuman talent. He did stuff on the violin that simply was not done before, and supposedly no one has come close since. It's said that he would purposely file nicks into his strings so they would break during his performance, after which he would finish the song on one string. He was classical, but had folk influences which are particularly apparent on this track. The melody really sounds like a bunny hopping through the forest, being chased by an axe-weilding maniac.\n@[509855932427215:274:Bombastic Dubstep]\nhttps://youtu.be/7KgHXzAvaCI"

However... I am having to deal without any pain medication, which is impeding the healing process and lowering my quality of life greatly. Why is this? . . .\n\nWhen I was recently living in Oregon I had a prescription for medical marijuana. Use of this wonderful plant has helped greatly with my nerve pain as well as lifted my spirits. Now here in New York it is thankfully about to be legalized. But since I have tested positive for this substance, I am no longer allowed to be prescribed any narcotics. I still have extensive nerve and tissue damage that needs to be healed before I will be even close to comfortable without this medication, but the excessively strict laws prevent me from having access to it.\n\nWhat do you think of this?"

Nothing ruins a keyboard piece worse than a player who bangs it out too fast without letting it breathe. Except for the Prokofiev Toccata, which should be played as fast as humanly possible. Her Chopin is especially good... But out of everything I heard her play over the years, it was the Scarlatti that grabbed me the most, and I would ask her repeatedly to play it throughout my whole life... sometimes years would go by and she would forget it but I begged her to learn it again. And she was captivated by it each time... It has the elegance of baroque music (which is when it was written) but the harmonic complexity of later classical, it was totally ahead of its time. \"This is PURE MUSIC\", she would say. This is all I want to hear right now - luckily if I listen to 5 volumes a day, it will last a for a whole week. This playlist contains all 555 harpsichord sonatas, but the user put the 34 disks in reverse order. Play them backwards, last video first and you'll hear them in the chronological order in which they were written. Oh and the harpsichord is perfect because there's no silly dynamics, you get each note in your face full strength!"

When the class began, he wordlessly picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.\nThe professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full.. The students responded with a unanimous \u00e2\u0080\u0098yes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099The professor then produced two Beers from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar effectively filling the empty space between the sand.The students laughed..\u00e2\u0080\u0098Now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the professor as the laughter subsided, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things\u00e2\u0080\u0094-your family, your children, your health, your friends and your favorite passions\u00e2\u0080\u0094-and if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house and your car.. The sand is everything else\u00e2\u0080\u0094-the small stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u0098If you put the sand into the jar first,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life.If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important to you.Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.Spend time with your children. Spend time with your parents. Visit with grandparents. Take your spouse out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and mow the lawn.Take care of the golf balls first\u00e2\u0080\u0094-the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the Beer represented. The professor smiled and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad you asked.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The Beer just shows you that no matter how full your life may seem, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always room for a couple of Beers with a friend.\""

That's what I had to do before social media if I wanted people to hear something. It got a great response - it was quite an amazing thing to be hanging around downtown and hear a car drive by blasting my song, pull over next to me and roll the window down while singing along! It was actually one of my first attempts at electronic music, and now here's a brand-new version a decade later."

I'm AWESOME at philosophy, but it's also a waste of time.\n3. I'm a damn good writer. But I also learned that no good writer thinks they are, so I must not be.\n4. Music for me is second-nature.

I just can't sleep\") is a little tricky, it's an F for 4 measures and then it goes C# / C Fm (\"Crazy but it feels alright\") and then C# C (\"Every day and every night\"). I think that's right... am I too confusing?"

Or did it... check it out:\n\nI was playing outside in my front yard in my hometown of Seneca Falls, NY.  Immediately once the conscious part of the dream begins, I look up towards the road at a terrible sight... my kitty cat... getting run over by a car. (Oh no!!!)\n\nI know it didn't get hit by the tire.  It went perfectly straight over.  As I run up towards the street to see if the cat was dead or not, I start to notice something quite strange...\n\nIt wasn't my cat.  It wasn't a cat at all.  Or, it WAS a cat, my kitty cat, but something about its existence was seriously changed during the time the car passed over it.  It was not a dead cat... nor was it alive.\n\n\"It turned into a pile of cookies,\" my mom said.\n\nAnd as I walk up to take a closer look, in fact, it was true.\n\nLying in the middle of the road, was nothing but a pile of chocolate chip cookies where the cat (or what we thought was the cat) was.\n\nThen... out of nowhere...(remember, this IS a nightmare)...\n\nA big ugly clown head, filling my entire field of vision, screams at me!  I wake up, screaming as well, sweaty...\n\n\n\nAll through my childhood I have had other recurring dreams involving dead cats.  Cats falling out of 2-story windows... Dead cats lying in boxes...\n\nDo you think this means anything?\n\nRaphael"
