    "I'm often asked why I'm not collecting disability, since I only have one working hand. My accident happened in 2015, and indeed if things had worked out differently, I wouldn't have to work another day in my life. Because of my failure to do this I've been a heavy burden on friends and family ever since. Some of them have literally begged me to pursue it, and my failure to has been chalked up to some combination of negligence and stubbornness. I certainly don't claim to *not* be those things. But the reason here is much different, and hopefully I can explain it a little to clear up some confusion. What follows is not my personal opinion, but the result of several doctor visits and medical examinations.\n\nA person's disability status is dependent upon their occupation. What would be a completely devastating event (eg. losing a hand) to one person, say, a carpenter, might be practically inconsequential to another, or at least not a significant hinderance to their productivity in their chosen profession. I happen to fall into this second category. Believe it or not... programming really does not require much typing at all. Mostly just thinking, and I do that just fine. This is why it is common to see people collecting checks for what seems like much less serious shortcomings than mine.\n\nIn 2016, I went back to school (again). But this time I decided to put my music degree on hold and study more academic subjects, eventually falling in love with psychology. But then, my funding suddenly went away and I ended up on the street, and was forced to leave Austin because the police would not leave me alone. It has been a great struggle ever since, but I've managed to teach myself computer science over the last 4 years and have gained some very employable skills.\n\nIt's simply a matter of persistence. I have 3 different potential employers I'm talking to right now. But much more importantly, I absolutely love what I do! I wouldn't trade this decision for anything."}],

    "Covid Lockout Day #2\n\nSleep? We don't do much of that while in lockout. Not very safe, ironically because of the threat of police harassment. That's not what this post is about, but having spent many years on the street, reality has reminded me once again who the real thugs are.\n\nAnother thing that I've rediscovered about myself is that I come up with some of my best ideas when I walk around all night. And it could be that the rhythm of my footsteps activates my musical sense, because I'm turning my attention once again to the construction of my software synthesizer, the MECCA Platform. And this time it's all about math.\n\nWhat's the huge deal with me and math lately, anyway? Well, the truth is, I'm 39 years old and the first time I actually used math was 3 years ago, when I decided to start building my own music application from first principles.\n\nI used to laugh in people's faces who would suggest such a ridiculous idea, that *music* has anything to do with *math*. But now I know that they were right, and now I know why.\n\nThis is all fitting together quite well, because this application, \"MECCA\", the Music Education Composition Creation Application, is all about being a tool for music production that also *teaches* you about theory and sound design by exposing to the user sonic parameters that are directly modeled from the acoustic principles at play, which become the actual parameters used to modulate the soundwaves. In addition to this educational component, another factor at play is *my own* education, which is being forged by the grand journey of me building the thing! I'm teaching *myself* about the fundamentals of music by learning to code a synth myself. And the stuff I'm discovering has been rather mindblowing:\n\nMusic IS math. I wouldn't go so far as to say that's *all* it is, but a nearly infinite amount of computation is involved in its every aspect. Here they are, in the order of my own discovery:\n\n1. The pitches of the notes. The human faculty of audio perception is very interesting because it operates on a logarithmic scale, both in volume (dB) and pitch (Hz). In pitch, this is clearly demonstrated by the frets of a guitar, which get closer together as you go higher up the neck. This is because each note needs to be calculated as 2^1/12 the frequency of the one preceding it.\n\n2. Tempo (bpm). Effectively this comes down to the *length* of the notes. To calculate note length of a quarter-note from beats-per-minute you need to divide 60 seconds by the desired tempo. Fun fact: James Best, my high school jazz band director once asked, \"which note determines the tempo of the song?\" The correct answer: the second one. It's the 2nd beat that tells you how far they are apart, right? While that makes sense in a practical setting, as far as the notes are concerned the answer is *every note*! Every note needs to be exactly the correct length with respect to the song's tempo.\n\n3. The very soundwaves themselves! Any acoustic sound can be mathematically described by its Fourier constants - a set of Complex (Real/Imaginary) numbers that, when run through a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), will result in the production of the waveform.\n\n4. Scales. Music notation is in fact a graph-fitting problem, as the notes are spaced at cycling intervals from each other. These scales must then be fit along the graph - representing the intervals on a 2-dimensional plane with time as the x-axis and pitch as the y-axis.\n\n5. Harmony. The overtone series comes into play here, which is an infinitely ascending cascade of notes that emanate from any acoustic tone.\n\n6. *All the computation performed by the human auditory system*. This includes the entire phenomenon of psychoacoustics, also related to the overtone series above. This is how our sense of hearing is adapted towards identifying the location and quality of the sound as it is situated in the sonic environment.\n\nMost of these connections were relatively unknown to me when I began this project just a few years ago. I knew that I wanted to create a synthesizer/sequencer with a more transparent and interactive set of parameters by which to control the sound. For example, it was to feature a \"kick-drum wizard\" that guides you through the construction of a kick drum, giving the experienced producer unprecedented control while unobtrusively revealing to the novice what sonic building blocks are composed to create a kick drum. But I just realized it goes much deeper still!\n\nIntroducing: MECCA-Math. The first digital audio workstation that is controlled completely algorithmically, exposing the very math that affects the character of the sound as the primary method of user input. We will be able to adjust the equations and receive sonic feedback in real time, bridging the intuitive gap between the human experience of music that we all know and love, and the algorithms that constitute them, all presented through a human-tractable interface tuned to provide the optimal balance of sonic flexibility while subtly encouraging the use of effective culturally prescribed idioms.\n\nI surely can't be the *only* one excited about this...\nMECCA Music Platform"}],

    "Covid Lockout Day #1\n\nWhy \"lockout\"? Because when you don't have anywhere to lockdown *to*, you're *locked out*. So I might as well make the best of this unprecedented experience by writing about it each day that I'm able to.\n\nFortunately????? (for me???) this lockdown is a bit of a joke. Because there actually seems to be plenty of places open. There's people hanging out everywhere - it's like a festival, actually. Pretty weird... feels all sorts of wrong. But life must go on. If this was a real lockdown, you'd think there wouldn't be anywhere for me to go, but today I went to the library and was actually able to gather enough mental focus to get a bunch of work done. Helping people in the community with software issues, expanding my computer algebra system I'm writing for a new educational platform, and taking part in the Exercism Markathon - a day my team planned for us all to spend working on our big upcoming release.\n\nWhere am I going to sleep? Don't know yet. And tomorrow is Sunday which is usually the trickiest as far as library hours go. I'm so dead focused on working on these projects that I refuse to let anything stop me, so every minute is spent planning how I am to maintain progress and will be documenting it all right here.\n\nI'm excited to be making some great progress on my math library: https://github.com/porkostomus/algae It now includes a complete set of functions for performing operations on polynomials. Next up is complex numbers. What this Computer Algebra System (CAS) is about is creating a system for people to learn math through programming. One way you could look at it is that I'm making a thing to help students cheat on their math homework. But the joke is actually on them, I guess, because through this process it ends up teaching them the important concepts behind the math while skipping the painful parts that cause too many people to grow up thinking that they hate math.\n\nMy team and I at exercism.io have been hard at work. Our website, which is already super cool and is made up of thousands of people all learning and teaching each other, is being completely revamped into an online coding platform. I've taken up the responsibility of building the code analyzer that works behind the scenes testing the user's solutions and providing instantaneous feedback. And I'm also the main person designing the curriculum and writing the exercises for the Clojure track. It's a wonderful and very rewarding thing to be involved with.\n\nIt's probably too soon for this idea, but I'm thinking I'd like to teach a programming class right here at the Ashland Public Library. Since thats where I'm gonna be spending all my time, it just makes sense, right? If you know anyone who might be interested in a new career in making computer beep boop boop beep... please spread the word. The classes will be free, and the only donations I'll be accepting are leads on places to live.\n\nIf for some reason you'd like to support me on these endeavors by sending me money, that'd be awesome too! Every coffee that I'm able to purchase is another chance for me to sit down and get shit done.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/porkostomus?fan_landing=true\nLiberapay: https://en.liberapay.com/porkostomus/\nPayPal: btowers793@gmail.com"}

While it is a very noble thing to try to educate others, the person must be ready to receive what you are trying to communicate or you will be likely met with unexpected results. This can be extremely difficult especially if they are family or close friends, but there are most likely better ways you could be spending your time and energy.\n\n2. Don't call them a racist! This is unproductive, lacking in compassion, and will actually completely backfire and drive them deeper into their corner. No one ever said, \"Hmm, that person on the internet just called me a racist, so I think I'm gonna take a long hard think about myself\".\n\nWhat *do* you say? I'm afraid I don't know! This is where I think I need some help."}],

    "It seems like nobody fully knows what is going on, and we are all put into a situation like Descartes where we need to go through a process of throwing all knowledge out the window and reconsidering what we consider \"facts\".\n\nWhen I think of \"facts\", I think of the protagonist in the movie \"Memento\". He suffers from anterograde amnesia as the result of an accident, and from that point on is unable to form new memories. His intermittent blackouts cause him to invent tactics to constantly re-teach himself everything he knows for sure, as he attempts to unravel the case of who murdered his wife.\n\nThese tactics include keeping a room with \"Facts\" plastered all over the wall, taking polaroid snapshots of everyone he meets, and if some piece of critical information is revealed. he must immediately have \"facts\" tattooed onto his body before he inevitably forgets it.\n\nIn a strange way we are all suffering from this condition. What are your \"facts\"?"}],

    "One time I took some LSD and decided to listen to a bunch of Phil Spector recordings.\n\nPhil Spector was a famous music producer who introduced all sorts of wild recording techniques, including the novel idea of the \"studio as an instrument\". He said that the job of a producer is to assist in the creation of something so unique, that no one could ever possibly recreate it.\n\nThen for some reason, at the end of the playlist, on came \"Born in the USA\". Some people in the room overheard, and we all shared a moment of wonder, laughing quite a bit at how repetitive the lyrics were. What was he even talking about? Why is he so proud to be born in the USA, and why the need to scream it so passionately like 87 times?\n\nPerhaps you had to be there. The song turned into kind of a running joke in my home, which led me to sit down to learn it. Still, I had found it more entertaining to preserve the lyrical ambiguity of the song (as well as our running joke) through willful ignorance than to bother trying to read and analyze it.\n\nNow that the lockdown protesters have brought the song into the news with a much more embarrassing failure of interpretation, my curiosity can at last be put to rest.\n\nGod bless this great nation."}],

    "Very well said. I do believe this to be a valid cause of the tendency to latch on to such irrational explanations. I imagine others could exist as well. A friend of mine once disagreed, and said that it is actually a form of abuse. I've spent some time trying to really understand what he meant.\n\nA completely natural response to a situation of mass uncertainty could be to deliberately (even unconsciously) cause confusion as a way of gaining/maintaining power.\n\nThis already starts to sound curiously like the very thing the conspiracy theorists are claiming.\n\nExcept conspiracy theorists actually exist."}

    "My main game plan is to spend a few weeks just backpacking around,and  then to settle down and study for what could become any number of weeks or months(on even years, I suppose).  I currently have very few leads but I am confident that they will appear when they need to.  And that's pretty much it.   I seem to be at the biggest turning point of my life and am completely overwhelmed with excitement.  I can't believe I'm actually doing this..."}],

    "All right, how's this?\n\nJust had to change my hat.  I was originally signed up with Aish HaTorah, and then my Rabbi recommended this one...  Jewish Renewal is the movement I'm currently involved with, so I guess I'll fit right in!!  We're the ones whos shabbat services sound more like rock concerts and we can davven shachrit in 50 words or less!  Shrimp and Pork may only be eaten in chinese restaurants, and our high holidays... wait, I'd better not get myself in trouble already..."}],

    "I grew up near Ithaca, NY.....then I moved to the west coast 2 years ago to start over.  And now....I'm actually going on this trip as another spy, to see if the grapes and pomegranates are really as huge as our ancestors say.  I will most likely be traveling with you all one way, and when our tour is all over, that's when I'll start my real adventure in the land.  No way, if I'm flying all the way to Israel, am I coming back here after a week and a half...\nCheck out some of my original jewish music here: http://www.myspace.com/raphaelyaakov\nSee you all soon!"}],
